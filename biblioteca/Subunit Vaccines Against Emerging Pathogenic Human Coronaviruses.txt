Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from humans so far. Among them, three
emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly
identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in
humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in
humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while
MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported
from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December
2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case
fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their
natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human
infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation
and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of
vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none
of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the
structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current
vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized
recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These
subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptorbinding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins,
and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall,
this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new
2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential. This review was written for
the topic of Antivirals for Emerging Viruses: Vaccines and Therapeutics in the Virology

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Othocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae of
the order Nidovirales. According to the 10th Report on Virus Taxonomy from the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the Othocoronavirinae is comprised of four
genera, including alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV), betacoronavirus (beta-CoV), gammacoronavirus

Wang et al. Subunit Vaccines Against Coronaviruses
(gamma-CoV), and deltacoronavirus (delta-CoV) (King et al.,
2018). Alpha- and beta-CoVs can infect mammals, including
but not limited to bats, pigs, cats, mice, and humans (Kusanagi
et al., 1992; Li et al., 2005b; Poon et al., 2005; Drexler et al.,
2014; Pedersen, 2014; Kudelova et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2019).
Gamma- and delta-CoVs usually infect birds, while some of
them could infect mammals (Woo et al., 2009a, 2012, 2014; Ma
et al., 2015). Since the late sixties, CoVs have been recognized
as one of the viral sources responsible for the common cold.
Among all CoVs identified so far, seven have the ability to
infect humans, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)
and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), which belong to
alpha-CoVs (Hamre and Procknow, 1966; Chiu et al., 2005),
as well as human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human
coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the newly emerged
coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which are known to be beta-CoVs
(Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Vabret et al., 2003; Woo
et al., 2005; Zaki et al., 2012; Du et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2020;
Zhu et al., 2020) (Figure 1).
Four human CoVs, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63,
HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1, have been identified in humans,
but without causing severe infections. HCoV-229E was isolated
from nasal secretions of medical students with minor upper
respiratory disease. This virus was an original isolate, and was first
reported in the 1960s (Hamre and Procknow, 1966). In addition
to HCoV-229E, several studies have reported the recovery of
HCoV-OC43 from patients with upper respiratory tract illness
(Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965; Hamre et al., 1967; McIntosh et al.,
1967; Kapikian et al., 1969). In 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated
from clinical species of infants suffering from pneumonia or
bronchiolitis, and characterized for its ability to infect human
respiratory tract (Fouchier et al., 2004; van der Hoek et al.,
2004). The subsequent study in 2005 identified a new member
of CoVs, named HCoV-HKU1, from a 71-year-old man with
pneumonia (Woo et al., 2005). Generally, these four viruses are
the most common pathogens causing mild upper respiratory
infection or asymptomatic infection, and count for about 30%
of all colds (Myint, 1994; Lau et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2017).
In the serological surveillance on healthy adults, HCoV-229E,
HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 demonstrated more than 90%
seropositive with the immunological assay. It appears common
for these CoVs to infect children (Mourez et al., 2007; Shao
et al., 2007; Severance et al., 2008). In contrast to the above
three human CoVs, HCoV-HKU1 has around 50% seropositive
in healthy individuals and a relatively low exposure rate in
children (Lehmann et al., 2008; Severance et al., 2008). Although
the prevalence of various CoVs is different, the incidence
among these viruses shows no significant difference (Woo et al.,
2009b). The afore-mentioned four CoVs have been detected
in 2.1–17.9% of clinical specimens (Esper et al., 2006; Lau
et al., 2006; Gerna et al., 2007; Regamey et al., 2008; Matoba
et al., 2015; Killerby et al., 2018). These viruses have also
been associated with lower respiratory tract illness in children,
elders, and immunodeficient individuals (Falsey et al., 2002;
Fouchier et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2006). HCoV229E and HCoV-OC43 may lead to central nervous system
infection since viral RNAs are detected in the brain of some
patients (Arbour et al., 2000; Desforges et al., 2014).
Unlike the above four human CoVs, SARS-CoV, MERSCoV, and 2019-nCoV have caused severe pneumonia and/or
failure of other organs, even death, among infected populations
(Nicholls et al., 2003; Zhong et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012;
Zhu et al., 2020). The epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV began
in the Guangdong Province of China in November 2002, and
spread through human-to-human transmission to other parts
of the world within a few months (Ksiazek et al., 2003). From
November 2002 to August 2003, SARS-CoV infected more than
8,098 people in 29 counties, resulting in over 774 deaths with
∼10% fatality rate (Du et al., 2009a). Palm civets serving as a
potential intermediate host of this virus were traced immediately
(Tu et al., 2004). Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus)
are the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005b). Various
bat SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoV) have been identified in
Yunnan, China, several of which can infect human cells, and
have been further characterized (Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017).
These discoveries indicate the threat of re-emergence of SARSCoV or SARSr-CoV.
A decade later, another highly pathogenic human CoV,
MERS-CoV, emerged, and the first patient with MERS-CoV
infection was reported in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 (Zaki
et al., 2012). By December 26, 2019, a total of 2,494 laboratoryconfirmed cases of MERS, including 858 associated deaths in
27 countries (fatality rate 34.4%), were reported to the WHO1
.
Globally, the majority (about 80%) of human cases have been
reported in Saudi Arabia, where people get infected through
direct contact with infected dromedary camels or persons2
(Zaki et al., 2012). Isolation of MERS-CoV and detection of
neutralizing antibodies from dromedary camels suggest that
these camels are potentially an important intermediate host
(Reusken et al., 2013; Azhar et al., 2014). Similar to SARSCoV, MERS-CoV is also an emerging zoonotic virus (Li and
Du, 2019). Bats habituate several CoVs phylogenetically related
to MERS-CoV, and some of them are identical to MERS-CoVs,
suggesting that MERS-CoV may originate from bats (Annan
et al., 2013; Lelli et al., 2013; Lau et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018a).
Different from SARS-CoV, which has not caused infections
in humans since 2004 (Du et al., 2009a), the transmission
of MERS-CoV has not been interrupted, and the infected
human cases continue increasing1
(Mobaraki and Ahmadzadeh,
2019). Currently, human-to-human transmission of MERSCoV is limited.
A new CoV, 2019-nCoV, has caught worldwide attention
(Liu and Saif, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). It was first identified
in Wuhan, China in December 2019, from patients with
pneumonia (Zhu et al., 2020), and has infected more than
70000 people globally, including 2,009 deaths (∼2.7% fatality

GENOME OF EMERGING HUMAN
CORONAVIRUSES, AS WELL AS
STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THEIR
KEY PROTEINS
The human CoVs are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense,
single-stranded RNA genome. They are 80–160 nm in diameter.
Like other CoVs, human CoVs contain the largest viral genome
[27–32 kilobase pairs (kb)] among the RNA viruses, and they
share similar genome organization (Fehr and Perlman, 2015).
Two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF 1a and
ORF 1b, occupy two-thirds of the genome at the 50
-terminus, and
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 298

Wang et al. Subunit Vaccines Against Coronaviruses
a third of the genome at the 30
-terminus encodes four common
structural proteins in the gene order of spike (S), envelope
(E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (50–30
) (Fehr and
Perlman, 2015). The large ORF 1ab is a replicase gene encoding
polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1b/1ab, which can be cleaved into
15–16 non-structural proteins (nsp2-nsp16 or nsp1-nsp16) by
3C-like proteinase (3CLpro, nsp5) and papain-like proteinase
(PLpro, nsp3) (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014; Fehr and Perlman, 2015;
Tomar et al., 2015; Snijder et al., 2016). In addition to the
genes encoding the above structural proteins, the genes encoding
accessory proteins have also been detected in the 30
region
between S–E–M–N (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). Some beta-CoVs,
such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, contain hemagglutininesterase (HE) gene located between ORF 1ab and S gene encoding
an additional structural protein, HE (De Groot et al., 2011;
Desforges et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2015). Similar to other human
CoVs, SARS-CoV possesses a ∼29-kb genome, which encodes
pp1a and pp1ab, four main structural proteins (S, E, M, and
N), and eight accessory proteins, such as 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a,
8b, and 9b (Figure 2A) (Marra et al., 2003; Snijder et al., 2003).
The MERS-CoV genome is about 30 kb in length and encodes
pp1a, pp1ab, four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N), and
five accessory proteins (3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b) (Figure 2A) (van
Boheemen et al., 2012). The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV is packed inside capsid formed by the N protein,
while the M, E, and S proteins form the envelope surrounding the
capsid (Figure 2B). Accessory genes may incorporate into virions
at low levels (Liu et al., 2014). Nevertheless, neither SARS-CoV
nor MERS-CoV appears to contain the HE gene (Rota et al., 2003;
Zaki et al., 2012).
Several proteins of human CoVs are important for viral
infection and/or pathogenesis. For example, most nsps
participate in viral RNA replication and/or transcription
(Snijder et al., 2016). The accessory proteins interact with host
cells, potentially helping the viruses to evade the immune system
and increase their virulence (Menachery et al., 2017). The HE
protein assists in the attachment of virus–host cells, thus playing
a key role in the production of infectious virions, as in the case
of HCoV-OC43 (Desforges et al., 2013). The M and E proteins
are responsible for virus assembly or promote virulence (Scobey
et al., 2013; DeDiego et al., 2014). Different from the above
proteins, the S protein of human CoVs mediates viral entry
into host cells and subsequent membrane fusion, enabling viral
infection (Du et al., 2009a; Lu et al., 2014). The S protein is a
class I viral protein, which can be cleaved into two functional
subunits, an amino-terminal S1 subunit and a carboxyl-terminal
S2 subunit. The S1 subunit is responsible for virus–host cell
receptor binding, whereas the S2 subunit is involved in virus–
host membrane fusion (Li et al., 2005a; Lu et al., 2014). The S1
contains two major domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and
a C-terminal domain (CTD). In general, NTDs mediate sugar
binding (Li, 2016; Li et al., 2017; Ou et al., 2017; Hulswit et al.,
2019; Tortorici et al., 2019), whereas CTDs facilitate protein
receptor recognition (Wong et al., 2004; Hofmann et al., 2006;
Lu et al., 2013). The NTDs and CTDs of the S1 subunit can bind
host receptors or function as receptor-binding domains (RBDs)
(Lu et al., 2013; Hulswit et al., 2019). The entry of human CoVs
relies on the interaction between viral and cellular membrane
proteins. Recognition of S1 subunit with a receptor and/or
sugar on the cell surface initiates the infection (Li, 2015). After
the initial recognition and binding, the S protein undergoes
conformational changes, followed by membrane fusion through
the S2 region (Li, 2015, 2016; Du et al., 2017). Consequently, the
viral genetic materials are delivered into the host cell through the
fusion core (Du et al., 2009a).
Similar to HCoV-NL63 (Hofmann et al., 2005; Li, 2015),
SARS-CoV recognizes, through the RBD in the CTD region of
its S1 subunit, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the
receptor on the target cell (Li et al., 2003). The RBD (CTD) in
two states (standing or lying) has been observed in the trimeric S
protein. ACE2 binds to standing RBD, specifically in the receptorbinding motif (RBM), keeping the RBD in the “standing” state
(Yuan et al., 2017). In addition to human ACE2, SARS-CoV S
protein could also bind to palm civet and mouse ACE2s (Li et al.,
2004; Li, 2008). Mutations in the RBD of S1 subunit are required
for cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005c; Li,
2008, 2016). Several bat SARSr-CoVs have been identified, and
these CoVs can utilize human ACE2 as their receptor to bind
the target cells (Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017). The structure
of SARS-CoV S trimer and RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor is
shown in Supplementary Figures S1A,B.
MERS-CoV RBD shares a structure similar to that of the
homology domain of SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2013). However,
antibodies induced by SARS-CoV RBD have no cross-reactivity
and/or cross-neutralizing activity to MERS-CoV (Du et al.,
2013b). Moreover, MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4
(DPP4) as a receptor through the RBD (CTD) region (Raj et al.,
2013), which is distinct from the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2.
Although the core regions of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBDs
are similar, their RBM regions are significantly different, which
explains why they recognize different receptors (Li, 2015). MERSCoV S trimer also maintains a structure similar to that of SARSCoV S trimer. Both standing and lying states can be detected in
the MERS-CoV RBDs, whereas DPP4 only binds to the standing
RBD (Pallesen et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017). MERS-CoV is
clustered with Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 in the
subgenus Merbecovirus. Ty-BatCoV HKU4, but not Pi-BatCoV
HKU5, could use human DPP4 as a receptor (Yang et al., 2014b).
Recently, some MERS-related CoVs (MERSr-CoVs) have been
discovered from bats that can enter human DPP4-expressing cells
(Lau et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018a). These findings suggest that
the emergence of MERSr-CoV may threaten human health owing
to their potential for cross-species transmission. The MERS-CoV
S protein and RBD and their complexes, along with the DPP4
receptor, are shown in Supplementary Figures S1C,D.
Recent studies have found that the new human CoV, 2019-
nCoV, which belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV, shares high
sequence identify (about 79.5%) to SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2020).
The genome of 2019-nCoV encodes pp1ab (translated from ORF
1ab), four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N), and six accessory
proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 10) (Figure 2A). Same as SARSCoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to have no HE gene.
The virion of 2019-nCoV consists of similar structure as SARSCoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 2B). Like SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV

its binding with the viral receptor has not yet been available.
OVERVIEW OF VACCINES AGAINST
EMERGING PATHOGENIC HUMAN
CORONAVIRUSES
Unlike the four low pathogenic human CoVs, including
HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1,
which cause mild to no pathogenesis in humans, SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, and 2019-CoV are three highly pathogenic human
CoVs (Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017; Cui et al., 2019;
Zhu et al., 2020). With the increasing numbers of 2019-nCoV and
MERS-CoV infections and continuous threat of re-emergence of
SARS-CoV, as well as the potential of SARS- and MERS-related
CoVs to cause human infections, it is critical to develop vaccines
with strong efficacy and safety targeting these viruses to prevent
their infections in humans. Since the vaccines against 2019-nCoV
have not been available, the rest of the review will focus on the
vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, most of them are in the preclinical
studies, and only several have been tested in clinical trials4,5
(Du et al., 2016b; Cho et al., 2018). Nevertheless, no vaccines

Wang et al. Subunit Vaccines Against Coronaviruses
have been approved for the prevention of SARS and MERS
in humans, demonstrating the need to develop effective and
safe vaccines to control current MERS-CoV infection, or to
be stockpiled for potential use against re-emerged SARS-CoV
or SARSr-CoV. Particularly, effective and safe vaccines are
urgently needed to prevent and control the current outbreak
of 2019-nCoV.
Most SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines developed thus
far are based on the inactivated or live attenuated viruses,
DNAs, proteins, nanoparticles, viral vectors, including viruslike particles (VLPs) (Zeng et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005;
Liu et al., 2005; Du et al., 2009a, 2016b; Pimentel et al.,
2009; Al-Amri et al., 2017). Each vaccine type has different
advantages and disadvantages. For instance, inactivated and liveattenuated virus-based vaccines are vaccine types developed
using the most traditional approaches. Although they generally
induce highly potent immune responses and/or protection, the
possibility for incomplete inactivation of viruses or recovering
virulence exists, resulting in significant safety concerns (Zhang
et al., 2014). Also, these traditional vaccines may induce the
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, as in the case
of SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2018b). Similarly, some
viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular
immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but
they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity, causing some harmful immune responses.
Instead, DNA and nanoparticle vaccines maintain strong
safety profile; however, the immunogenicity of these vaccines
is usually lower than that of virus- or viral vector-based
vaccines, often requiring optimization of sequences, components,
or immunization routes, inclusion of appropriate adjuvants,
or application of combinational immunization approaches
(Zhang et al., 2014).
SUBUNIT VACCINES AGAINST
SARS-CoV AND MERS-CoV
Subunit vaccines are vaccines developed based on the synthetic
peptides or recombinant proteins. Unlike inactivated or liveattenuated virus and some viral vectored vaccines, this vaccine
type mainly contains specific viral antigenic fragments, but
without including any components of infectious viruses,
eliminating the concerns of incomplete inactivation, virulence
recovery, or pre-existing immunity (Du et al., 2008; Deng
et al., 2012). Similar to DNA or VLP-based vaccines, subunit
vaccines are generally safe without causing potential harmful
immune responses, making them promising vaccine candidates.
Moreover, subunit vaccines may target specific, well-defined
neutralizing epitopes with improved immunogenicity and/or
efficacy (Du et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014).
A number of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV have been developed, and these are described
in detail in the next paragraphs. The targets used for the
development of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV subunit vaccines are
also be discussed.
Potential Targets for Development of
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Subunit
Vaccines
The S protein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV plays a vital role
in receptor binding and membrane fusion. Thus, the S protein,
but not other structural proteins, is the major antigen to induce
protective neutralizing antibodies to block viruses from binding
their respective receptor and thus inhibit viral infection (Bisht
et al., 2004; Buchholz et al., 2004; Bukreyev et al., 2004; Yang
et al., 2004). As a result, the S protein is also a major target for the
development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERSCoV. Both full-length S protein and its antigenic fragments,
including S1 subunit, NTD, RBD, and S2 subunit, can serve as
important targets for the development of subunit vaccines (Guo
et al., 2005; Mou et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015; Jiaming et al.,
2017; Zhou et al., 2018).
Although subunit vaccines based on the full-length S protein
may elicit potent immune responses and/or protection, studies
have found that antibodies induced by some of these vaccines
mediate enhancement of viral infection in vitro, as in the
case of SARS-CoV (Kam et al., 2007; Jaume et al., 2012),
raising safety concerns for the development of full-length S
protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERSCoV. In contrast, RBD-based subunit vaccines comprise the
major critical neutralizing domain (Du and Jiang, 2015; Zhou
et al., 2019). Therefore, these vaccines may generate potent
neutralizing antibodies with strong protective immunity against
viral infection. S1 subunit, for example, is much shorter than
the full-length S protein, but it is no less able to induce strong
immune responses and/or protection against viral infection (Li
et al., 2013; Adney et al., 2019). Thus, this fragment can be used
as an alternative target for subunit vaccine development. Despite
their ability to induce immune responses and/or neutralizing
antibodies, NTD and S2 as the targets of subunit vaccines are
less immunogenic, eliciting significantly lower antibody titers,
cellular immune responses, and/or protection than the other
regions, such as full-length, S1, and RBD (Guo et al., 2005;
Jiaming et al., 2017). Therefore, in terms of safety and efficacy,
the RBD and/or S1 of S protein could be applied as critical
targets for the development of subunit vaccine candidates against
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARSr-CoV, and MERSr-CoV. Because
of its conserved amino acid sequences and high homology among
different virus strains (Elshabrawy et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2018),
the S2 subunit has potential to be used as a target for the
development of universal vaccines against divergent virus strains.
In addition to the S protein, the N protein of SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV may serve as an additional target for the
development of subunit vaccines. Unlike S protein, the N protein
has no ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies to block virusreceptor interaction and neutralize viral infection, but it may
induce specific antibody and cellular immune responses (Liu
et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2009). Several immunodominant B-cell
and T-cell epitopes have been identified in the N protein of SARSCoV and MERS-CoV, some of which are conserved in mice,
non-human primates, and humans (Liu et al., 2006; Chan et al.,
2011; Veit et al., 2018). Other proteins, such as M protein, can be

Wang et al. Subunit Vaccines Against Coronaviruses
used as potential targets of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV subunit
vaccines. Notably, SARS-CoV M protein-derived peptides have
immunogenicity to induce high-titer antibody responses in the
immunized animals (He et al., 2005b), suggesting the potential
for utilizing this protein to develop subunit vaccines.
Subunit Vaccines Against SARS-CoV
Numerous subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV have been
developed since the outbreak of SARS, the majority of which use
the S protein and/or its antigenic fragments, in particular, RBD,
as the vaccine target (Table 1).
SARS-CoV Subunit Vaccines Based on Full-Length S
Protein
Subunit vaccines based on SARS-CoV S protein, including fulllength or trimeric S protein, are immunogenic with protection
against SARS-CoV infection (He et al., 2006a; Kam et al.,
2007; Li et al., 2013). Either insect cell-expressed full-length
(FL-S) or extracellular domain (EC-S) SARS-CoV S protein
developed high-titer S-specific antibodies with neutralizing
activity against pseudotyped SARS-CoV expressing S protein of
representative SARS-CoV human and palm civet strains (Tor2,
GD03, and SZ3) isolated during the 2002 and 2003 or 2003
and 2004 outbreaks (He et al., 2006a). In addition, full-length
S-ectodomain proteins fused with or without a foldon trimeric
motif (S or S-foldon) could elicit specific antibody responses
and neutralizing antibodies, protecting immunized mice against
SARS-CoV challenge with undetectable virus titers in the lungs
(Li et al., 2013). Moreover, a subunit vaccine (triSpike) based
on a full-length S protein trimer induced specific serum and
mucosal antibody responses and efficient neutralizing antibodies
against SARS-CoV infection (Kam et al., 2007). Nevertheless, this
vaccine also resulted in Fcγ receptor II (FcγRII)-dependent and
ACE2-independent ADE, particularly in human monocytic or
lymphoblastic cell lines infected with pseudotyped SARS-CoV
expressing viral S protein, or in Raji B cells (B-cell lymphoma
line) infected with live SARS-CoV (Kam et al., 2007; Jaume et al.,
2012), raising significant concerns over the use of full-length S
protein as a SARS vaccine target.
SARS-CoV Subunit Vaccines Based on RBD
SARS-CoV RBD contains multiple conformation-dependent
epitopes capable of eliciting high-titer neutralizing antibodies;
thus, it is a major target for the development of SARS vaccines
(He et al., 2004, 2005a; Jiang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013). Subunit
vaccines based on the SARS-CoV RBD have been extensively
explored. Studies have found that a fusion protein containing
RBD and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of human IgG1
(RBD-Fc) elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies against
SARS-CoV in the immunized rabbits and mice, which strongly
blocked the binding between S1 protein and SARS-CoV receptor
ACE2 (He et al., 2004). This RBD protein induced long-term,
high-level SARS-CoV S-specific antibodies and neutralizing
antibodies that could be maintained for 12 months after
immunization, protecting most of the vaccinated mice against
SARS-CoV infection (Du et al., 2007). In addition, recombinant
RBDs (residues 318–510 or 318–536) stably or transiently
expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells bound strongly
to RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), elicited hightiter anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, and protected most,
or all, of the SARS-CoV-challenged mice, with undetectable viral
RNA and undetectable or significantly reduced viral load (Du
et al., 2009c, 2010). Significantly, a 293T cell-expressed RBD
protein maintains excellent conformation and good antigenicity
to bind SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing mAbs. It elicited
highly potent neutralizing antibodies that completely protected
immunized mice against SARS-CoV challenge (Du et al., 2009b).
Particularly, RBDs from the S proteins of Tor2, GD03, and SZ3,
representative strains of SARS-CoV isolated from human 2002–
2003, 2003–2004, and palm civet strains, can induce high-titer
cross-neutralizing antibodies against pseudotyped SARS-CoV
expressing respective S proteins (He et al., 2006c). Different
from the full-length S protein-based SARS subunit vaccines, no
obvious pathogenic effects have been identified in the RBD-based
SARS subunit vaccines (Kam et al., 2007; Jaume et al., 2012).
SARS-CoV Subunit Vaccines Based on Non-RBD S
Protein Fragments
SARS subunit vaccines based on S protein fragments (S1 and
S2), other than the RBD, have shown immunogenicity and/or
protective efficacy against SARS-CoV infection (Guo et al., 2005;
Li et al., 2013). For example, recombinant S1 proteins fused with
or without foldon elicited specific antibodies with neutralizing
activity that protected immunized mice against high-dose SARSCoV challenge (Li et al., 2013). Although some studies have
demonstrated that recombinant SARS-CoV S2 (residues 681–
980) protein elicits specific non-neutralizing antibody response in
mice (Guo et al., 2005), others have indicated that mAbs targeting
highly conserved heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 domains of
SARS-CoV S protein have broad neutralizing activity against
pseudotyped SARS-CoV expressing S protein of divergent strains
(Elshabrawy et al., 2012), indicating the potential of utilizing the
S2 region as a broad-spectrum anti-SARS-CoV vaccine target
(Zheng et al., 2009).
SARS-CoV Subunit Vaccines Based on Non-S
Structural Proteins
Subunit vaccines based on the N and M proteins of SARSCoV have shown immunogenicity in vaccinated animals (Liu
et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2009). Studies have revealed
that a plant-expressed SARS-CoV N protein conjugated with
Freund’s adjuvant elicited specific IgG antibodies, including
IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, and cellular immune responses in
mice, whereas another E. coli-expressed N protein conjugated
with Montanide ISA-51 and cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)
adjuvants induced specific IgG antibodies toward a Th1
(IgG2a)-type response in mice (Liu et al., 2006; Zheng et al.,
2009). Although N-specific antibodies have been detected in
convalescent-phase SARS patient and immunized rabbit sera,
they have no neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV infection
(Qiu et al., 2005). In addition, immunodominant M protein
peptides (M1-31 and M132-161) identified using convalescentphase sera of SARS patients and immunized mouse and rabbit
sera have immunogenicity to elicit specific IgG antibodies in

Wang et al. Subunit Vaccines Against Coronaviruses
rabbits (He et al., 2005b). In spite of their immunogenicity,
it appears that these N- and M-based SARS subunit vaccines
have not been investigated for their protective efficacy against
SARS-CoV infection. Thus, it is unclear whether these nonS structural protein-based SARS subunit vaccines can prevent
SARS-CoV infection.
Potential Factors Affecting SARS-CoV Subunit
Vaccines
A number of factors may affect the expression of proteins
to be used as SARS subunit vaccines; apart from their
immunogenicity and/or protective efficacy. Understanding of
these factors is important to generate subunit vaccines with good
quality, high immunogenicity, and excellent protection against
SARS-CoV infection.
The expression of recombinant protein-based SARS subunit
vaccines may be changed by the following factors. First, addition
of an intron splicing enhancer to the truncated SARS-CoV
S protein fragments results in better enhancement of protein
expression in mammalian cells than the exon splicing enhancers,
and different cells may result in different fold increase of
protein expression (Chang et al., 2006). Second, inclusion of
a post-transcriptional gene silencing suppressor p19 protein
from tomato bushy stunt virus to a SARS-CoV N protein
may significantly increase its transient expression in tobacco
(Zheng et al., 2009).
The following factors may affect the immunogenicity and
protective efficacy of protein-based SARS subunit vaccines,
including same proteins expressed in different expression
systems, and same proteins with various lengths, amino acid
mutations, or deletions (He et al., 2006b; Du et al., 2009b).
For example, RBD proteins containing different lengths (193-
mer: RBD193-CHO or 219-mer: RBD219-CHO) elicited different
immune responses and protective efficacy against SARS-CoV
challenge (Du et al., 2009c, 2010). A recombinant SARS-CoV
RBD (RBD-293T) protein expressed in mammalian cell system
was able to induce stronger neutralizing antibody response than
those expressed in insect cells (RBD-Sf9) and E. coli (RBDEc) (Du et al., 2009b), suggesting that RBD purified from
mammalian cells has preference for further development due
to its ability to maintain native conformation. Notably, a single
mutation (R441A) in the RBD of SARS-CoV disrupted its major
neutralizing epitopes and affinity to bind viral receptor ACE2,
thus abolishing the vaccine’s immunogenicity, and hence, its
ability to induce neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals
(He et al., 2006b). Additionally, deletion of a particular amino
acid by changing a glycosylation site in the SARS-CoV RBD
(RBD219-N1) also resulted in the alteration of subunit vaccine’s
immunogenicity (Chen et al., 2014).
Other factors that potentially affect the immunogenicity
of SARS subunit vaccines include immunization routes and
adjuvants (Zakhartchouk et al., 2007; Li et al., 2013). Significantly
high-titer antibodies were induced by monomeric or trimeric
SARS-CoV S and S1 proteins through the intramuscular (I.M.)
route compared to the subcutaneous (S.C.) route (Li et al.,
2013). Moreover, a SARS-CoV RBD subunit vaccine conjugated
with Alum plus CpG adjuvants elicited a higher level of IgG2a
antibody and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) secretion than the RBD
with Alum alone (Zakhartchouk et al., 2007).
Subunit Vaccines Against MERS-CoV
Subunit vaccines against MERS-CoV have been developed
extensively, almost all of which are based on the S protein,
including full-length S timer, NTD, S1, and S2, particularly
RBD. These subunit vaccines, including their antigenicity,
functionality, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy in
different animal models, are summarized in Table 2.
MERS-CoV Subunit Vaccines Based on Full-Length S
Protein
Subunit vaccines based on the full-length S protein cover both
RBD and non-RBD neutralizing epitopes, some of which may
be located in the conserved S2 subunit; thus this type of
subunit vaccines are expected to induce high-titer neutralizing
antibodies. Although several MERS-CoV full-length S proteinbased vaccines have been reported in other vaccine types,
including viral vectors and DNAs (Wang et al., 2015; Wang C.
et al., 2017; Haagmans et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018), only
a few subunit vaccines have been developed that rely on
the full-length S protein. For example, a recombinant MERSCoV S protein trimer (MERS S-2P) in prefusion conformation
binds to the DPP4 receptor, as well as to the MERS-CoV
NTD, RBD, and S2-specific neutralizing mAbs (Pallesen et al.,
2017). Whereas this protein induces neutralizing antibodies
in mice against divergent pseudotyped MERS-CoV in vitro,
its in vivo protective activity against MERS-CoV infection
is unknown (Pallesen et al., 2017). Therefore, more studies
are needed to elucidate the potential for the development
of MERS-CoV full-length S-based subunit vaccines, including
understanding their protective efficacy and identifying possible
harmful immune responses.
MERS-CoV Subunit Vaccines Based on RBD
Numerous MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines have been
developed and extensively evaluated in available animal models
since the emergence of MERS-CoV (Table 2) (Du et al., 2013c;
Tai et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). In general, these subunit
vaccines have strong immunogenicity and are capable of inducing
high neutralizing antibodies and/or protection against MERSCoV infection (Ma et al., 2014b; Zhang et al., 2016; Tai et al.,
2017; Wang Y. et al., 2017). Most subunit vaccines based on the
MERS-CoV RBD have been described in detail in a previous
review article (Zhou et al., 2019). In this section, we will briefly
introduce these RBD-targeting MERS vaccines, and compare
their functionality, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and protection
against MERS-CoV infection.
Co-crystallographic analyses of MERS-CoV RBD and/or
RBD/DPP4 complexes have confirmed that the RBD is attributed
to residues 367–588 (Chen et al., 2013) or 367–606 (Lu et al.,
2013) in the MERS-CoV S1 subunit. Indeed, a recombinant
MERS-CoV RBD (rRBD) fragment (residues 367–606) elicits
RBD-specific antibody and cellular immune responses and
neutralizing antibodies in mice and/or non-human primates
(NHPs) (Lan et al., 2014, 2015). However, it only partially protects

Wang et al. Subunit Vaccines Against Coronaviruses
NHPs from MERS-CoV infection by alleviating pneumonia and
clinical manifestations, as well as decreasing viral load (Lan et al.,
2015). In addition, an RBD protein fragment containing MERSCoV S residues 377–622 fused with the Fc tag of human IgG can
induce MERS-CoV S1- and/or RBD-specific humoral and cellular
immune responses in the immunized mice with neutralizing
activity against MERS-CoV infection (Du et al., 2013c; Jiang
et al., 2013). However, after comparing several versions of MERSCoV RBD fragments with different lengths, it was found that
a truncated RBD (residues 377–588) had the highest DPP4-
binding affinity and induced the highest-titer IgG antibodies and
neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV, identifying its role as
a critical neutralizing domain (Ma et al., 2014b).
Subsequently, several MERS-CoV subunit vaccines have been
designed based on the identified critical neutralizing domain of
RBD fragment, including those expressed in a stable CHO cell
line (S377-588-Fc), fusing with a trimeric motif foldon (RBDFd), or containing single or multiple mutations in the RBD of
representative human and camel strains from the 2012–2015
MERS outbreaks (Tai et al., 2016, 2017; Nyon et al., 2018).
These RBD proteins maintain good conformation, functionality,
antigenicity, and immunogenicity, with ability to bind the DPP4
receptor and RBD-specific neutralizing mAbs and to elicit robust
neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralizing multiple strains of
MERS pseudoviruses and live MERS-CoV (Tai et al., 2016, 2017;
Nyon et al., 2018). It is noted that the wild-type MERS-CoV RBD
proteins consisting of the identified critical neutralizing domain
confer partial protection of hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice
from MERS-CoV infection without causing immunological
toxicity or eosinophilic immune enhancement (Tai et al., 2016;
Wang Y. et al., 2017; Nyon et al., 2018); nevertheless, a
structurally designed mutant version of such RBD protein with
a non-neutralizing epitope masked (T579N) preserves intact
conformation and significantly improves overall neutralizing
activity and protective efficacy, resulting in the full protection
of hDPP4-Tg mice against high-dose MERS-CoV challenge
(Du et al., 2016a).
The above studies indicate that protein lengths to be chosen
as MERS-CoV subunit vaccines and/or structure-based vaccine
design can impact on the immunogenicity and/or protection of
RBD-based subunit vaccines.
MERS-CoV Subunit Vaccines Based on Non-RBD S
Protein Fragments
MERS vaccines targeting non-RBD regions of S protein have
been developed and investigated in mice and NHPs. It has
been shown that a MERS-CoV S1 protein formulated with
Ribi (for mice) or aluminum phosphate (for NHPs) adjuvant
elicited robust neutralizing antibodies in mice and NHPs
against divergent strains of pseudotyped and live MERSCoV, protecting NHPs from MERS-CoV infection (Wang
et al., 2015). In addition, MERS-CoV S1 protein adjuvanted
with Advax and Sigma Adjuvant System induced low-titer
neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels with reduced
and delayed viral shedding after MERS-CoV challenge, but
high-titer neutralizing antibodies in alpacas with complete
protection of viral shedding from viral infection, indicating
that protection of MERS-CoV infection is positively correlated
with serum neutralizing antibody titers (Adney et al., 2019).
Moreover, immunization with a recombinant MERS-CoV NTD
protein (rNTD) can induce neutralizing antibodies and cellmediated responses, protecting Ad-hDPP4-transduced mice
against MERS-CoV challenge (Jiaming et al., 2017). Notably,
specific antibodies with neutralizing activity have been elicited
by a S2 peptide sequence (residues 736–761) of MERS-CoV
in rabbits (Yang et al., 2014a), but the protective efficacy
of this peptide vaccine is unknown. The above reports
demonstrate the potential for the development of MERS
subunit vaccines based on the non-RBD fragments of MERSCoV S protein.
MERS-CoV Subunit Vaccines Based on Non-S
Structural Proteins
Unlike SARS subunit vaccines which have been designed based
on viral N and M proteins, it appears that very few subunit
vaccines have been developed based on the non-S structural
protein(s) of MERS-CoV. One study reports the induction
of specific antibodies by MERS-CoV N peptides (Yang et al.,
2014a), and another report shows that N protein is used for
development of vaccines based on viral vector Vaccinia virus,
modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) (Veit et al., 2018). This
may be potentially a consequence of the weak immunogenicity
and/or protective efficacy of non-S structural proteins, further
confirming the role of MERS-CoV S protein as the key target for
the development of MERS vaccines, including subunit vaccines.
Potential Factors Affecting MERS-CoV Subunit
Vaccines
Similar to SARS-CoV subunit vaccines, the immunogenicity
and/or protection of MERS-CoV subunit vaccines may also be
affected by a number of factors, such as antigen sequences,
fragment lengths, adjuvants, vaccination pathways, antigen doses,
immunization doses and intervals used.
As described above, MERS-CoV subunit vaccines containing
different antigens or fragment lengths, particularly those based
on the RBD, have apparently variable immunogenicity and/or
protective efficacy, and a critical neutralizing domain that
contains an RBD fragment corresponding to residues 377–588 of
S protein elicits the highest neutralizing antibodies among several
fragments tested (Ma et al., 2014b; Zhang et al., 2015).
Adjuvants play an essential role in enhancing host immune
responses to MERS-CoV subunit vaccines, including those
based on the RBD, and different adjuvants can promote
host immune responses to variant levels (Lan et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2016). For example, while a MERS-CoV RBD
subunit vaccine (S377-588 protein fused with Fc) alone
induced detectable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses
in immunized mice, inclusion of an adjuvant enhanced its
immunogenicity. Particularly, among the adjuvants (Freund’s,
aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, Montanide ISA51 and
MF59) conjugated with this RBD protein, MF59 could best
potentiate the protein to induce the highest-titer anti-S
antibodies and neutralizing antibodies, protecting mice against
MERS-CoV infection (Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, a
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 13 February 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 298
fmicb-11-00298 February 27, 2020 Time: 15:35 # 14
Wang et al. Subunit Vaccines Against Coronaviruses
recombinant RBD (rRBD) protein plus alum and CpG adjuvants
elicited the highest neutralizing antibodies against pseudotyped
MERS-CoV infection, whereas the strongest T-cell responses
were induced by this protein plus Freund’s and CpG adjuvants
(Lan et al., 2014).
Vaccination pathways are important in inducing efficient
immune responses, and different immunization routes may elicit
different immune responses to the same protein antigens. For
example, immunization of mice with a MERS-CoV subunit
vaccine (RBD-Fc) via the intranasal route induced higher
levels of cellular immune responses and stronger local mucosal
neutralizing antibody responses against MERS-CoV infection
than those induced by the same vaccine via the S.C. pathway (Ma
et al., 2014a). In addition, while Freund’s and CpG-adjuvanted
rRBD protein elicited higher-level systematic and local IFNγ-producing T cells via the S.C. route, this protein adjuvanted
with Alum and CpG induced higher-level tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 4 (IL-4)-secreting T cells via the
I.M. route (Lan et al., 2014).
Antigen dosage, immunization doses, and intervals may
significantly affect the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV subunit
vaccines. Notably, a MERS-CoV RBD (S377-588-Fc) subunit
vaccine immunized at 1 µg elicited strong humoral and cellular
immune responses and neutralizing antibodies in mice although
the one immunized at 5 and 20 µg elicited a higher level of
S1-specific antibodies (Tang et al., 2015). In addition, among
the regimens at one dose and two doses at 1-, 2-, and 3-week
intervals, 2 doses of this protein boosted at 4 weeks resulted
in the highest antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against
MERS-CoV infection (Wang Y. et al., 2017).
POTENTIAL CHALLENGES AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES FOR SARS-CoV AND
MERS-CoV SUBUNIT VACCINES
Compared with other vaccine types such as inactivated virus
and viral-vectored vaccines, SARS and MERS subunit vaccines
are much safer and do not cause obvious side effects. However,
these subunit vaccines may face some important challenges,
mostly arising from their relatively low immunogenicity, which
must be combined with appropriate adjuvants or optimized for
suitable protein sequences, fragment lengths, and immunization
schedules. In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine
design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy
of subunit vaccines. This is evidenced by a structurally designed
MERS-CoV RBD-based protein which has significantly improved
neutralizing activity and protection against MERS-CoV infection
(Du et al., 2016a). It is prospected that more structureguided novel strategies will be developed to improve the
overall immunogenicity and efficacy of subunit vaccines against
emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses, including those
targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although a large number
of SARS and MERS subunit vaccines have been developed with
potent immunogenicity and/or protection in available animal
models, virtually all remain in the preclinical stage. It is thus
expected that one or several of these promising subunit vaccines
can be further processed into clinical trials to confirm their
immunogenicity against viral infections in humans.
RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF SUBUNIT
VACCINES AGAINST THE NEW
PATHOGENIC HUMAN CORONAVIRUS
Currently, the newly identified 2019-nCoV is spreading to infect
people, resulting in significant global concerns. It is critical to
rapidly design and develop effective vaccines to prevent infection
of this new coronavirus. Since S protein and its fragments, such
as RBD, of SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are prime targets for
developing subunit vaccines against these two highly pathogenic
human CoVs, it is expected that similar regions of 2019-nCoV
can also be used as key targets for developing vaccines against
this new coronavirus (Jiang et al., 2020). Similarly, other regions
of 2019-nCoV, including S1 and S2 subunits of S protein and
N protein, can be applied as alternative targets for vaccine
development. Taken together, the approaches and strategies in
the development of subunit vaccines against SARS and MERS
described in this review will provide important information for
the rapid design and development of safe and effective subunit
vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection.
