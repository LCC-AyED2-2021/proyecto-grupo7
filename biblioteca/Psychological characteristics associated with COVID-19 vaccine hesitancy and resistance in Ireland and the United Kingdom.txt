Identifying and understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy within distinct populations may
aid future public health messaging. Using nationally representative data from the general
adult populations of Ireland (N = 1041) and the United Kingdom (UK; N = 2025), we found
that vaccine hesitancy/resistance was evident for 35% and 31% of these populations
respectively. Vaccine hesitant/resistant respondents in Ireland and the UK differed on a
number of sociodemographic and health-related variables but were similar across a broad
array of psychological constructs. In both populations, those resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine
were less likely to obtain information about the pandemic from traditional and authoritative
sources and had similar levels of mistrust in these sources compared to vaccine accepting
respondents. Given the geographical proximity and socio-economic similarity of the populations studied, it is not possible to generalize findings to other populations, however, the
methodology employed here may be useful to those wishing to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy elsewhere.

1234567890():,;
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, reached pandemic
status on March 11th, 2020. As of September 11th, 2020, the
virus had spread to 213 countries and territories, infected over 28
million people, and resulted in over 900,000 deaths worldwide1.
The global economic cost of this pandemic over the next 2 years
is projected to lead to a cumulative output loss of nine trillion US
dollars2. In the absence of an effective therapy or vaccine, governments around the world enacted extreme physical distancing
and quarantine measures to slow the spread of the virus, protect
the most vulnerable in society, and manage health care service
demand and provision3. The necessity for an approved vaccine to
protect populations from this virus, as well as to safeguard
economies from continued disruption and damage, cannot be
overstated.
The first human clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine commenced on March 3rd, 2020 in the United States4, and several
other human trials commenced soon after5. As of September
11th, 2020, 8 vaccines had advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials and
2 had been approved for early or limited use6. Many trials are
ongoing. In an April 2020 study of 7664 people drawn from seven
European nations (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal,
the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (UK)), 18.9% of
respondents indicated that they were ‘unsure’ about taking a
vaccine for COVID-19, while a further 7.2% indicated that they
did not want to get vaccinated7. Identifying, understanding, and
addressing vaccine acceptance (i.e. a position ranging from passive acceptance to active demand)8, and vaccine hesitance and
resistance (i.e. the positions where one is unsure about taking a
vaccine or where one is absolutely against taking a vaccine)9 to a
vaccine for COVID-19 is, therefore, a potentially important step
to ensure the rapid and requisite uptake of an eventual vaccine.
Much of the existing literature on vaccine hesitance and
resistance focuses on the explicit reasons individuals provide for
their opposition to a particular vaccine or to vaccination programmes in general9–12. Although useful, this information is
limited in terms of its ability to explain why individuals come to
their respective epistemological positions13. A more informative
approach may be to identify the psychological processes that
characterise and distinguish vaccine hesitant and resistant individuals from those who are receptive to vaccines; an approach
that is reflective of the “attitude roots” model of science rejection14. Doing so not only helps to account for why vaccine
hesitant and resistant individuals come to hold the specific beliefs
that they do, but it may also provide an opportunity to tailor
public health messages in ways that are consistent with these
individuals’ psychological dispositions. Given that public service
campaigns advocating a variety of health behaviours have benefitted from psychologically oriented approaches15–17, public
health messaging efforts aimed at increasing the uptake of a
COVID-19 vaccine can benefit from a comprehensive understanding of the psychology of vaccine hesitant and resistant
individuals.
To date, a number of psychological constructs have been explored
in relation to vaccine hesitancy. For example, altruistic beliefs18, the
personality traits neuroticism and conscientiousness19,20, locus of
control21, and cognitive reflection22 have each been shown, in some
way, to influence vaccine acceptance/hesitancy. Vaccine hesitance/
resistance has also been associated with conspiratorial, religious, and
paranoid beliefs13,23–25, while mistrust of authoritative members of
society, such as government officials, scientists, and health care
professionals, has been linked to negative attitudes towards vaccinations26–30, as has endorsement of authoritarian political views,
societal disaffection, and intolerance of migrants31,32. Taken together, the existing literature indicates that there are likely to be several
psychological dispositions that traverse personality, cognitive styles,
emotion, beliefs, trust, and socio-political attitudes that distinguish
those who are hesitant or resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine from
those who are accepting.
With emerging research findings indicating that a substantial
proportion of European adults are hesitant about, or resistant to,
a vaccine for COVID-197, important work is required to begin to
understand and address this problem. The importance of identifying, describing, and understanding these individuals as a key
preparatory step for vaccine development is further emphasised
by the World Health Organization’s (WHO, 2014) Strategic
Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation33. It is
imperative, therefore, that we begin to understand the psychological characteristics that define and distinguish those who are
hesitant and resistant to a vaccine for COVID-19 from those who
are accepting. To achieve these goals, we developed four study
objectives.
First, we sought to determine what proportions of the general
adult populations of Ireland and the UK were accepting of,
hesitant about, or resistant to a vaccine for COVID-19.
Second, we sought to profile individuals who are hesitant
about, or resistant to, a possible vaccine for COVID-19 by
identifying the key sociodemographic, political, and healthrelated factors that distinguish these individuals from those
who are accepting of a COVID-19 vaccine. By identifying these
distinguishing, objective characteristics, public health officials
may be better able to identify who in the population is more likely
to be hesitant or resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine.
Third, we sought to identify the most salient psychological
characteristics that distinguish individuals who are hesitant/
resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine from those who are accepting. A
better understanding of the psychology of vaccine hesitant and
resistant individuals affords public health officials a more complete understanding of why these individuals view a COVID-19
vaccine the way that they do.
Finally, we sought to determine from which sources vaccine
hesitant and resistant individuals gather information about the
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the level of trust they place in
these sources. Taken together, these latter two objectives offer a
greater understanding of how public health officials can effectively tailor health behaviour messaging to align to the psychological profiles of vaccine hesitant or resistant individuals, while
also taking into account their consumption and trust proclivities
relating to COVID-19 information.
Results
Data from nationally representative samples of the general adult
populations of Ireland (N = 1041) and the UK (N = 2025) were
collected. The sociodemographic characteristics for both samples
are reported in Table 1.
Objective 1: prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and resistance in
Ireland and the UK. Overall, 65% (95% CI = 62.0, 67.9) of Irish
respondents were accepting of a COVID-19 vaccine, 26% (95%
CI = 22.9, 28.3) were hesitant about such a vaccine, and 9% (95%
CI = 7.7, 11.3) were resistant to such a vaccine. Comparatively,
69% (95% CI = 66.8, 70.9) of UK respondents were vaccine
accepting, 25% (95% CI = 23.1, 26.9) were vaccine hesitant, and
6% (95% CI = 5.2, 7.3) were vaccine resistant. Figure 1 displays
the proportions in these three groups for Ireland and the UK
overall, as well as for its devolved nations of England, Wales,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland. As can be seen, Northern Ireland
had the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance at 51%.
Objective 2: sociodemographic, political, and health variables
associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance.

The full set of findings from the multinomial logistic regression
analyses for the Irish and UK samples are presented in Tables 2
and 3, respectively.
In the Irish sample, those who were vaccine hesitant –
compared to those who were vaccine accepting – were more likely
to be female (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.18, 2.22), aged between 35
and 44 years (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.06, 3.75), and less likely to
have received treatment for a mental health problem (AOR =
0.63, 95% CI = 0.45, 0.88). Those who were vaccine resistant –
compared to those who were vaccine accepting – were more likely
to be aged 35–44 years (AOR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.17, 9.47),
residing in a city (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.02, 3.54), to be of
non-Irish ethnicity (AOR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.17, 7.09), to have
voted for the political party Sinn Féin (AOR = 3.22, 95% CI =
1.14, 9.08) or an Independent political candidate (AOR = 4.15,
95% CI = 1.19, 14.49) in the previous general election, and to
have an underlying health condition (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI =
1.38, 4.85). Income level was also associated with vaccine
resistance where those in lower income brackets were more
likely to be vaccine resistant.
Three variables distinguished those who were vaccine resistant
from those who were vaccine hesitant: non-Irish ethnicity (AOR
= 2.76, 95% CI = 1.05, 7.19), having an underlying health
condition (AOR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.33, 5.38), and having a lower
level of income (AORs ranged from 2.82 to 5.44, 95% CIs ranged
from = 1.04, 7.66 to 1.98, 14.93).
In the UK sample, those who were vaccine hesitant – compared
to those who were vaccine accepting – were more likely to be
female (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.14, 1.80), and to be younger than
65. Those who were vaccine resistant – compared to those who
were vaccine accepting – were more likely to be in younger age
categories (over ten times more likely to be in the three lowest age
categories, and over four times more likely to be aged 45–54 years
or 55–64 years, than to be in the 65 and older category). They
were also more likely to reside in a suburb (OR = 2.13, 95% CI =
1.01, 4.49), to be in the three lowest income brackets, and to be
pregnant (OR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.03, 5.40).
The only variable to distinguish vaccine resistant respondents
from vaccine hesitant respondents in the UK sample was age.
Those who were vaccine resistant were more likely to be in
younger age categories (over seven times more likely to be aged
18–24, and over four times more likely to be aged between 25–34
years and 35–44 years, than to be in the 65 and older age
category).
Objective 3: psychological indicators of vaccine acceptance/
hesitancy/resistance. The variation in measures of respondent
psychology across the vaccine acceptance, hesitance, and resistance groups in the Irish and UK samples is reported in Tables 4
and 5, respectively.
In the Irish sample, the combined vaccine hesitant and
resistant group differed most pronouncedly from the vaccine
acceptance group on the following psychological variables: lower
levels of trust in scientists (d = 0.51), health care professionals
(d = 0.45), and the state (d = 0.31); more negative attitudes
toward migrants (d’s ranged from 0.27 to 0.29); lower cognitive
reflection (d = 0.25); lower levels of altruism (d’s ranged from
0.17 to 0.24); higher levels of social dominance (d = 0.22)
and authoritarianism (d = 0.14); higher levels of conspiratorial
(d = 0.21) and religious (d = 0.20) beliefs; lower levels of the
personality trait agreeableness (d = 0.15); and higher levels of
internal locus of control (d = 0.14).
When comparing the three groups in the Irish sample, the
vaccine resistant group differed from the vaccine hesitant group
in terms of higher levels of conspiracy beliefs (η2 = 0.02), and
lower levels of trust in scientists (η2 = 0.06), health care
professionals (η2 = 0.05), and the state (η2 = 0.03).

In the UK sample, the combined vaccine hesitant and resistant
group differed most clearly from the vaccine acceptance group on
the following psychological variables: lower levels of trust in
health care professionals (d = 0.39), scientists (d = 0.38), and the
state (d = 0.16); higher levels of paranoia (d = 0.27) and religious
beliefs (d = 0.21); lower levels of altruism (d’s ranged from 0.17 to
0.22); higher levels of social dominance (d = 0.21); lower levels of
the personality traits agreeableness (d = 0.22) and conscientiousness (d = 0.17), and higher levels of neuroticism (d = 0.11);
higher levels of internal locus of control (d = 0.16) and belief in
chance (d = 0.17), and lower levels of beliefs about the role of
powerful others (d = 0.19); lower cognitive reflection (d = 0.14);
and more negative attitudes towards migrants (d = 0.11).
When comparing the three groups in the UK data, the vaccine
resistant group differed from the vaccine hesitant group in terms
of higher levels of conspiracy beliefs (η2 = 0.01), and lower levels
of trust in scientists (η2 = 0.03) and health care professionals
(η2 = 0.04).
Objective 4. consumption of, and trust in, information
regarding COVID-19. Figures 2, 3 show the levels of consumption of, and trust in, sources of information for each of the
vaccine response groups in the Irish sample. Compared to the
vaccine accepting respondents, the vaccine resistant respondents
consumed significantly (p < 0.05) less information about COVID19 from newspapers, television, radio, and government agencies,
and significantly more information from social media. In relation
to trust of the different information sources, compared to the
vaccine accepting respondents, the vaccine resistant respondents
reported significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of trust in information that was disseminated via newspapers, television broadcasts,
radio broadcasts, their doctor, other health care professionals, and
government agencies.
There were no significant differences in levels of consumption
and trust between the vaccine accepting and vaccine hesitant
groups in the Irish sample. Compared to vaccine hesitant
responders, vaccine resistant individuals consumed significantly
less information about the pandemic from television and radio,
and had significantly less trust in information disseminated from
newspapers, television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, their doctor,
other health care professionals, and government agencies.
Figures 4, 5 show the levels of consumption of, and trust in,
sources of information for each of the vaccine response groups in
the UK sample. The vaccine resistant group consumed significantly (p < 0.05) less information about COVID-19 from
newspapers and television broadcasts compared to the vaccine
accepting group. In relation to trust in the available information,
compared to the vaccine accepting respondents, vaccine resistant
respondents reported significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of trust
in information that was disseminated via newspapers, television
broadcasts, radio broadcasts, their doctors, other health care
professionals, and government agencies.
There were no significant differences between the vaccine
accepting and vaccine hesitant groups regarding levels of
consumption or trust in information. Likewise, there were no
significant differences in information consumption between the
vaccine hesitant and resistant groups, but the vaccine resistant
group did have significantly less trust in information sourced
from newspapers, radio broadcasts, their doctor, and other health
care professionals.
Discussion
Similar rates of vaccine hesitance (26% and 25%) and resistance
(9% and 6%) were evident in the Irish and UK samples, with only
65% of the Irish population and 69% of the UK population fully
willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. These findings align with
other estimates across seven European nations where 26% of
Fig. 1 Rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitance, and resistance in Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK), and in the four devolved nations of
the UK. Data are presented as the proportion of the Irish (N = 1041) and United Kingdom (N = 2025) samples indicating COVID-19 vaccine acceptance
(dark blue), hesitance (grey), and resistance (light blue) in the first two bar-charts on the left side of the figure. Error bars present the 95% confidence
intervals of these proportions. The same information is presented for the four devolved nations of the United Kingdom on the right side of the figure. Source
data are provided as a Source Data file.

adults indicated hesitance or resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine7
and in the United States where 33% of the population indicated
hesitance or resistance34. Rates of resistance to a COVID-19
vaccine also parallel those found for other types of vaccines. For
example, in the United States 9% regarded the MMR vaccine as
unsafe in a survey of over 1000 adults35, while 7% of respondents
across the world said they “strongly disagree” or “somewhat
disagree” with the statement ‘Vaccines are safe’
36. Thus, upwards
of approximately 10% of study populations appear to be opposed
to vaccinations in whatever form they take. Importantly, however,
the findings from the current study and those from around
Europe and the United States may not be consistent with or
reflective of vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, or resistance in nonWestern countries or regions.
The sociodemographic profile of COVID-19 vaccine hesitant
and resistant people. Across the Irish and UK samples, similarities and differences emerged regarding those in the population
who were more likely to be hesitant about, or resistant to, a
vaccine for COVID-19. Three demographic factors were
significantly associated with vaccine hesitance or resistance in
both countries: sex, age, and income level. Compared to
respondents accepting of a COVID-19 vaccine, women were
more likely to be vaccine hesitant, a finding consistent with a
number of studies identifying sex and gender-related differences
in vaccine uptake and acceptance37,38. Younger age was also
related to vaccine hesitance and resistance. However, whereas in
the UK all age groups under the age of 65 were more likely to be
hesitant or resistant than accepting, only those aged between
35–44 were more likely to be hesitant or resistant in Ireland.
Consistent with previous research39, vaccine resistance was
associated with lower income in the UK and Ireland with all
earning categories below the highest income bracket associated
with COVID-19 vaccine resistance.
Similarity in sociodemographic predictors of COVID-19
vaccine hesitance and resistance across Ireland and the UK may
not be considered unusual given their geographical proximity. In
Ireland, vaccine resistance was also associated with non-Irish
born status, city dwelling, having voted for an anti-establishment
or independent candidate in the most recent general election, and

having an underlying chronic health problem; while in the UK,
vaccine resistance was associated with suburban dwelling and
being pregnant. Urban/suburban dwelling may reflect broader
socioeconomic issues known to underpin vaccine hesitancy40–43,
and is a worrying finding given the greater potential for
community transmission within more densely populated areas.
Vaccine uptake among minority groups is often lower than that
among the general population44–46, and the reasons for this
disparity may include limited access to primary care, failure of
clinical staff to communicate the importance of vaccination
during health care visits, and/or misconceptions about the costs,
adverse effects, risks, and benefits of vaccination47–49. Greater
resistance to vaccination seen in populations with existing
chronic health problems may be explained by the presence of
individuals for whom vaccines are medically contraindicated or
by a fear of iatrogenic effects of a vaccine among these
individuals50–52. Pregnancy has also been found to be associated
with increased resistance to vaccines for other communicable
diseases, such as influenza and pertussis53–55.
Taken together, our findings show that although there are
some similarities regarding who in the Irish and UK populations
are most likely to be hesitant about, or resistant to, a potential
COVID-19 vaccine, many of the determining factors are likely to
be context-dependent. Therefore, national public health authorities can use these findings in two ways. First, based on the
common risk factors for vaccine hesitance/resistance across the
samples, public health campaigns could be targeted at groups
more likely to be vaccine hesitant or resistant, including women,
younger adults, and those of lower socioeconomic status. Second,
based on the unique risk factors for vaccine hesitance/resistance
across the samples, public health authorities in different nations
should seek to replicate our work with a view to identifying the
characteristics of vaccine hesitant or resistant sub-groups within
their own contexts, and direct public health messaging to
specifically target these groups. A multi-disciplinary approach
engaging social and behavioural change communication experts,
social marketers, medical anthropologists, psychologists, and
health care practitioners is likely to be required.

resistant individuals in Ireland and the UK varied in relation to
their social, economic, cultural, political, and geographical characteristics, both populations shared similar psychological profiles.
Specifically, COVID-19 vaccine hesitant or resistant persons were
distinguished from their vaccine accepting counterparts by being
more self-interested, more distrusting of experts and authority
figures (i.e. scientists, health care professionals, the state), more
likely to hold strong religious beliefs (possibly because these kinds
of beliefs are associated with distrust of the scientific worldview)
and also conspiratorial and paranoid beliefs (which reflect lack of
trust in the intentions of others). They were also more likely to
believe that their lives are primarily under their own control, to
have a preference for societies that are hierarchically structured
and authoritarian, and to be more intolerant of migrants in
society (attitudes that have been previously hypothesised to be
consistent with, and understandable in the context of, evolved
responses to the threat of pathogens)56. They were also more
impulsive in their thinking style, and had a personality characterised by being more disagreeable, more emotionally unstable,
and less conscientious.
Reaching those who are hesitant or resistant to a COVID-19
vaccine. Responsibility for public health messaging primarily lies
with governments, scientists, and medical professionals. The high
level of distrust that vaccine hesitant and resistant people have for
those who represent established authority is likely to provoke
psychological resistance to any message emanating from these
sources, and to an entrenchment of their existing ‘anti-establishment’ or ‘anti-authority’ beliefs. Consequently, anti-vaccine
beliefs may be expressed by some individuals in society as a way
to advertise their ‘anti-establishment’ sentiments. By understanding the psychological dispositions of these individuals,
another – potentially more effective – approach could be adopted.
For example, recognising their preference for social dominance
and authoritarianism, and their distrust of conventional authority
figures, vaccine hesitant or resistant persons may be more
receptive to authoritative messages regarding COVID-19 vaccine
safety and efficacy if they are delivered by individuals within nontraditional positions of authority and expertise. Engagement of
religious leaders, for example, has been documented as an
important approach to improve vaccine acceptance16,57. Key to
the preparation of a COVID-19 vaccine is, therefore, the early
and frequent engagement of religious and community-leaders58,
and for health authorities to work collaboratively with multiple
societal stakeholders to avoid the feeling that they are only acting
on behalf of government authorities59.
Moreover, given their lack of altruism, their internal locus of
control, and their anti-migrant views, messages tailored to
vaccine hesitant or resistant individuals could emphasise the
personal benefits of vaccination against COVID-19, and the
benefits to those with whom they most closely identify.
Furthermore, given that the results of this study indicate that
vaccine hesitant or resistant individuals are typically less agreeable, less conscientious, less emotionally stable, and less
analytically capable, public health messaging targeted at these
persons should be clear, direct, repeated, and positively
orientated.

government authorities, vaccine resistant individuals in both
countries were less likely to consume, and trust, information from
‘traditional’ sources (i.e. newspapers, television, radio, and
government agencies), and were somewhat more likely to obtain
information from social media channels. These findings are
consistent with global trends and other studies reporting social
media as an instrumental platform for anti-vaccine
messaging60,61. This poses further challenges to effective communication with vaccine resistant individuals, and highlights the
need for public health officials to disseminate information via
multiple media channels to increase the chances of accessing
vaccine resistant or hesitant individuals. Knowledge of the
sociodemographic and psychological profiles of vaccine hesitant/resistant individuals, combined with knowledge of what
information sources they access, and whom they trust most,
provides important information for public health officials to
effectively design and deliver public health messages so that a
sufficient proportion of the population will voluntarily accept a
vaccine for COVID-19.
Study limitations. These findings should be interpreted in light
of several limitations. First, quota sampling was used to recruit
both non-probability-based samples via the internet. This opt-in
mode of recruitment employed by the survey company who
facilitated the data collection (Qualtrics), albeit being a costeffective method for gaining fast access to a large and diverse
sample (and largely the only feasible method of recruitment
during the pandemic), inevitably meant that it was not possible to
generate a response rate for the baseline survey due to the lack of
a known denominator or sampling frame. Whilst more research
is required to fully investigate the strengths and weaknesses
associated with internet-based panel surveying62, it has been
suggested that the composition of non-probability internet-based
survey panels differs from that of the underlying population63.
Indeed, the American Association for Public Opinion Research
(APPOR) asserts that when non-probability sampling methods
are used, there is a higher burden of responsibility on investigators to describe the methods used to draw the sample and collect
the data, so that users can make an informed decision about the
usefulness of the resulting survey estimates64. We support the
APPOR’s position that it is useful to think of different nonprobability sampling approaches as falling on a continuum of
expected accuracy of the survey estimates; at one end are
uncontrolled convenience samples that produce risky survey
estimates by assuming that respondents are a random sample of
the population, whereas at the other end, there are surveys that
recruit respondents based on criteria related to the survey subject
matter and then the survey results are adjusted using variables
that are correlated with the key study outcome variables64. The
design of the current studies ensures that it falls towards the latter
end of this continuum.
Second, these data were collected during the first week of the
strictest lockdown measures that had ever been imposed in
Ireland and the UK, respectively. Thus, rates of vaccine
acceptance, hesitance, and resistance will have been affected by
these social circumstances. Third, questions were answered with
regards to a hypothetical vaccine whose effectiveness, risk of
adverse side-effects, and contraindications were unknown.
Continued monitoring throughout the pandemic, and throughout
the development of the vaccine(s) for COVID-19, will help us to
better understand changing levels of hesitance and resistance to
vaccination, and our group are engaging in this work.

Fourth, the current study was also limited to two western,
European countries, whose populations had many social, cultural,
economic, and political similarities. Relatedly, the extent to which
these results will generalise to other nations is unknown, though
the similarity of results – especially with respect to the
psychological profiles we have identified – in at least two
different countries is promising. It is essential that many other
(low, middle, and high income) countries obtain estimates of
hesitancy/resistance to COVID-19 vaccination in the general
population. As is abundantly clear, the spread of the virus does
not respect national borders and only a global vaccination
programme will lead to success. Nations across the world could
potentially prepare for the delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine by
identifying psychological characteristics associated with hesitancy
and resistance in their populations and honing their public
messaging in order to maximise vaccine uptake.
Finally, while the use of nationally representative samples from
two countries is a key strength, these samples are representative of
general adult populations and do not include members of the
public that are institutionalised (e.g. hospital care, prisons,
refugee centres) or difficult to reach (e.g. those not online, the
homeless, etc.). The inability to survey these members of society
also limits the generalisability of our results.
Despite these limitations, our findings provide important
evidence regarding the level of hesitance and resistance toward a
potential COVID-19 vaccine in two general population samples.
The development of a vaccine for COVID-19 represents an
enormous ongoing global scientific and political effort; however,
our findings suggest that if this global effort is successful and a
vaccine is delivered, governments and health workers in many
countries are likely to face another battle: how to persuade a
sufficient proportion of their populations to accept the vaccine to
effectively suppress the virus. We offer these findings in the hope
that they highlight the importance of understanding the various
social, economic, political, and psychological factors that
contribute to COVID-19 vaccine hesitance and resistance, and
how they can be used to maximise the positive effect of public
health messaging. Convincing members of the public who are
hesitant or resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine will require the
concerted efforts of multiple stakeholders in society, many of
whom are often excluded from mainstream politics and health
policy65. The engagement and participation of these key and
trusted community actors will likely be required to effectively
reach and convince a sufficient proportion of individuals in the
general population of the necessity of COVID-19 immunisation.
Methods
Participants and procedure. Data from nationally representative samples of the
general adult populations of Ireland (N = 1041) and the UK (N = 2025) were
collected by the survey company Qualtrics. These data were collected as part of the
COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study66 to track the
mental health and societal impact of the pandemic across both countries. Quota
sampling was used to ensure that the sample characteristics of sex, age, and geographical distribution matched known population parameters for the Irish population, while age, sex and income matched known population parameters for the
UK population. The UK data collection took place between March 23rd and 28th,
2020. Data collection began 52 days after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in
the UK, and the same day the UK Prime Minister announced that people were
required to stay at home except for very limited purposes. The Irish data collection
took place between March 31st and April 5th, 2020. This was 31 days after the first

confirmed case of COVID-19 in Ireland, 19 days after the first physical distancing
measures were enacted (i.e. closure of all childcare and educational facilities), and
two days after the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) announced that people were
not to leave their homes except for very limited purposes. Therefore, these data
were collected within the first week of the strictest physical distancing measures
being enacted in both countries.
Power analyses were conducted to determine the optimal sample sizes for both
countries. As the C19PRC Study was primarily concerned with tracking mental
health disorders (depression, generalised anxiety disorder [GAD], and
posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) in the general population, sample size
calculations were based on existing prevalence estimates for these disorders. In
Ireland and the UK, the estimated prevalence of PTSD is 5% and 4%, respectively,
and lower than the prevalence estimates of depression and generalised anxiety67.
To detect a disorder with a prevalence of 4%, with precision of 1%, and 95%
confidence level, a sample size of 1476 was required. The survey company used to
collect the data could only guarantee a maximum sample size of 1000 participants
in Ireland, whereas a larger sample could be obtained in the UK. This is a
consequence of the much smaller population of Ireland (4.9 million people)
compared to the UK (66.7 million people). Therefore, the target sample size in
Ireland was set at 1000 which, holding all other parameters in the sample size
calculation equal, resulted in a precision of 1.21%. In the UK, a target sample was
set at 2000 to increases the number of ‘cases’ detected because of the intention to
track changes in the mental health problems in the population over time.
Inclusion criteria for both samples were that participants be aged 18 years or
older at the time of the survey, resident in the country that the survey was
conducted, and be able to complete the survey in English. Participants were
contacted by the survey company via email and requested to participate. If
consenting, participants completed the survey online (median time of completion
= 37.52 and 28.91 min for the Irish and UK surveys, respectively) and were
reimbursed by the survey company for their time. Ethical approval for the study
was provided by the Research Governance Committee at University of Sheffield
(Reference number: 033759) and approved by the School of Psychology Ethics
Filter Committee at Ulster University (Reference number: 230320). The
sociodemographic characteristics for both samples are reported in Table 1.
Measures. Given the distinct socio-political contexts of Ireland and the UK, some
variation existed in the measurement of the sociodemographic and political
variables used in this study. All other variables were measured in an identical
manner across the two samples.
COVID-19 vaccination status. Participants were asked, ‘If a new vaccine were to
be developed that could prevent COVID-19, would you accept it for yourself?’ and
were classified as ‘vaccine accepting’ if they responded ‘Yes’, ‘vaccine hesitant’ if
they responded ‘Maybe’, and ‘vaccine resistant’ if they responded ‘No’.
Sociodemographic, political, and religious indicators. The sociodemographic
variables used in this study were directly informed by the extant evidence base
relating to vaccine hesitancy and are outlined in Table 5. In compliance with the
International Journal of Epidemiology guidelines on forming age categories we
categorised age from mid-decade to mid-decade (e.g. 35–44, 45–54)68. Additionally, the Irish and UK samples were asked about their voting behaviours in recent
political elections. In the Irish sample, people were asked if they voted in the
February 2020 General Election (0 = No, 1 = Yes), and to which political party
they gave their first preference vote (Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Other party,
Independents; 0 = No, 1 = Yes). In the UK sample, people were asked if they voted
in the most recent general election (0 = No, 1 = Yes), and how they voted in the
2016 European Union membership referendum (0 = Remain, 1 = Leave). In both
samples, respondents were asked “What is your religious conviction (how you
would classify your religious belief now)?”, with response options including:
Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Atheist, Agnostic, Other. A
binary variable was generated to represent ‘Religion’ where 1 = No religion
(combining atheist/agnostic?) and 0 = ‘Other’ (combining all other categories).
Health-related indicators. Participants were asked if they have diabetes, lung
disease, or heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes), if any immediate family members have
diabetes, lung disease, or heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes), if they are pregnant (0 =
No, 1 = Yes), if they have, or have had, a confirmed/suspected case of COVID-19
infection (0 = No, 1 = Yes), and if a close relative or friend has, or has had, a
confirmed/suspected case of COVID-19 infection (0 = No, 1 = Yes). Additionally,
participants were asked if they are currently, or have in the past, received mental
health treatment (i.e. medication or psychotherapy) for a mental health problem
(0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Psychological indicators. Personality traits: The Big-Five Inventory (BFI-10)69
measures the traits of openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each trait is measured by two items using a fivepoint Likert scale that ranges from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to ‘strongly agree’ (5).
While higher scores reflect higher levels of each personality trait, and Rammstedt
and John69 reported good reliability and validity for the BFI-10 scale scores,
internal reliability coefficients are not provided here. Because the scale measures
each trait using only two items, coefficient alpha is inappropriate for demonstrating
internal consistency70.
Locus of control. The Locus of Control Scale (LoC)71 measures internal (e.g. ‘My life
is determined by my own actions’) and external locus of control. The latter has two
components, ‘Chance’ (e.g. ‘To a great extent, my life is controlled by accidental
happenings’) and ‘Powerful Others’ (e.g. ‘Getting what I want requires pleasing
those people above me’). Each subscale was measured using three questions and a
seven-point Likert scale that ranges from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to ‘strongly agree’
(7). Higher scores reflect higher levels of each construct. The internal reliabilities of
the LoC subcomponents in both the Irish and UK samples were excellent (Internal
α = 0.67 & 0.71; Chance α = 0.63 & 0.70; Powerful Other α = 0.78 & 0.85,
respectively). The internal reliabilities of the Internal and Chance subscale scores in
the Irish sample were slightly lower than desirable (α = 0.67 & 0.63, respectively)
but somewhat stronger for the UK sample (α = 0.71 & 0.70, respectively), while
those for the Powerful Others subscale scores were excellent for both samples
(Ireland α = 0.78; UK α = 0.85).
Analytical/reflective reasoning. The Cognitive Reflection Task (CRT)72 is a threeitem measure of analytical reasoning where respondents are asked to solve logical
problems designed to hint at intuitively appealing but incorrect responses. The
response format was multiple choice with three foil answers (including the hinted
incorrect answer), as recommended by Sirota and Juanchich73. The internal reliabilities of the CRT scores in the Irish and UK samples were α = 0.67 and α = 0.69,
respectively).
Altruism. The Identification with all Humanity scale (IWAH)74 is a nine-item scale
adapted for use in this study (reference to ‘America’ in the original study was
substituted with ‘Ireland’ or ‘the UK’ for this study). Respondents are asked to
respond to three statements with reference to three groups – people in my community, people from Ireland/ the UK, and all humans everywhere. The three
statements were presented to respondents separately for each of the three groups,
as follows: (1) How much do you identify with (feel a part of, feel love toward, have
concern for) …? (2) How much would you say you care (feel upset, want to help)
when bad things happen to …? And, (3) When they are in need, how much do you
want to help…? Response scale ranged from 1 ‘not at all’ to 5 ‘very much’. Higher
scores reflect greater identification with others, care for others, and a desire to help
others. The internal reliabilities of each subscale of the IWAH in both the Irish and
UK samples were excellent (identification with others α = 0.79 & 0.81; care for
others α = 0.88 & 0.89; desire to help others α = 0.86 & 0.88, respectively).
Conspiracy beliefs. The Conspiracy Mentality Scale (CMS)75 measures conspiracy
mindedness using five items with each scored on an 11-point scale (1 = ‘Certainly
not 0%’ to 11 = ‘Certainly 100%’). Items include, ‘I think that many very important
things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about’, and ‘I think
that there are secret organisations that greatly influence political decisions’. The
internal reliability of the CMS in both the Irish and UK samples was excellent (α =
0.84 & 0.85, respectively).
Paranoia. The five-item persecution subscale from the Persecution and Deservedness Scale (PaDS)76 was used. Participants rate their agreement with statements
such as “I’m often suspicious of other people’s intentions towards me” and “You
should only trust yourself.” Response options ranged from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to
‘strongly agree’ (5) with higher scores reflecting higher levels of paranoia. The
psychometric properties of the scale scores have been previously supported77, and
the internal reliability in both the Irish and UK samples was excellent (α = 0.83 &
0.86, respectively).
Religious and atheist beliefs. Participants indicated their agreement to 8 statements
from the Monotheist and Atheist Beliefs Scale78. Statements included: “God has
revealed his plans for us in holy books” and “Moral judgments should be based on
respect for humanity rather than religious doctrine”. Response options ranged from
‘strongly disagree’ (1) to ‘strongly agree’ (5). Atheism oriented statements were
reverse scored and summed with monotheist items to produce a summed score,
with higher scores reflecting religious belief orientation. The psychometric properties of the scale scores have been previously supported78, and the internal
reliability in both the Irish and UK samples was excellent (α = 0.81 & 0.83,
respectively).
Trust in institutions. Respondents were asked to indicate the level of trust they have
in political parties, the parliament, the government, the police, the legal system,
scientists, and doctors and other health professionals. Responses were scored on a
five-point Likert scale ranging from ‘do not trust at all’ (1) to ‘completely trust’ (5).
For this study, responses to the first five institutions were summed to generate a
total score for ‘trust in the state’. Trust in scientists, and trust in doctors and other
health professionals were treated individually.
Authoritarianism. The Very Short Authoritarianism Scale (VSA)79 includes six
items assessing agreement with statements such as: ‘It’s great that many young
people today are prepared to defy authority’ and ‘What our country needs most is
discipline, with everyone following our leaders in unity’. All items were scored on a
five-point Likert scale ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to ‘strongly agree’ (5),
with higher scores reflecting higher levels of authoritarianism. The internal reliability of the scale scores in the Irish sample was lower than desirable (α = 0.58) but
somewhat stronger for the UK sample (α = 0.65).
Social dominance. Respondents’ levels of social dominance orientation were
assessed using the eight-item Social Dominance Scale (SDO7)80. Respondents were
asked the extent to which they opposed/favoured statements such as: ‘An ideal
society requires some groups to be on top and others to be on the bottom’; ‘Some
groups of people are simply inferior to other groups’; and ‘We should do what we
can to equalise conditions for different groups’. Response were scored using a 5-
point Likert scale ranging from 1 ‘Strongly oppose’ to 5 ‘Strongly Favour’. Ho and
colleagues demonstrated that the SDO7 had good criterion and construct validity80.
The internal reliability of the scale scores in both the Irish and UK samples was
excellent (α = 0.79 & 0.82, respectively).
Attitude towards migrants. Two items assessing respondents’ attitudes towards
migrants were taken from the British Social Attitudes Survey 201581. These were,
(1) ‘Would you say it is generally bad or good for the UK’s economy that migrants
come to the UK from other countries?’ (scored on a 10-point scale ranging from 1
‘extremely bad’ to 10 ‘extremely good’), and, (2) ‘Would you say that the UK’s
cultural life is generally undermined or enriched by migrants coming to live here
from other countries?’ (scored on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 ‘undermined’ to
10 ‘enriched’). These items were phrased appropriately for use with the Irish
sample.
COVID-19 information consumption and trust. Participants were asked, ‘How
much information about COVID-19 have you obtained from each of these sources?’, and were presented with nine options: Newspapers, Television, Radio,
Internet websites, Social media, Your doctor, Other health professionals, Government agencies, and Family or friends. Responses were recorded on a four-point
Likert scale (1 = none, 2 = a little, 3 = some, 4 = a lot). Participants were also
asked, ‘How much do you trust the information from each of these sources?’, and
responses were recorded on a four-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 =
some, 4 = a lot).
Data analysis. The analytical strategy involved four elements linked to the study
objectives. First, the proportion of people in the Irish and UK samples classified as
‘vaccine accepting’, ‘vaccine hesitant’, and ‘vaccine resistant’ were calculated.
Second, multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the
key sociodemographic, political, and health-related indicators associated with
vaccine hesitancy and resistance. Analyses were performed separately for the Irish
and UK samples. For these analyses, the vaccine acceptance group was set as the
reference category to identity factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and vaccine
resistance, respectively. Subsequently, the models were re-estimated with the
vaccine hesitant group set as the reference category to identify which factors
distinguished vaccine resistant respondents from vaccine hesitant respondents. All
associations between the predictor and criterion variables are represented as
adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (i.e. all predictors are
adjusted for all other covariates in each model).
Third, a series of one-way between-groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests
with Bonferroni post-hoc tests were performed to determine on what psychological
characteristics vaccine hesitant and resistant people differ from vaccine accepting
people. Statistically significant differences are reported at both the standard alpha
level (p < 0.05) and at a stricter level (p < 0.001) to account for the potential for
increased Type 1 errors due to multiple testing. These analyses were performed for
the Irish and UK samples separately. The magnitude of the effect between the three
means was quantified in terms of eta-squared (η2) where values ≤ 0.05 reflect a
small effect size, values from 0.06 to 0.13 reflect a medium effect size, and values ≥
0.14 reflect a large effect size82. Additionally, the vaccine hesitant and resistant
groups were combined to represent a single group, and this group was compared to
the vaccine accepting group on all psychological variables. The magnitude of the
effect between the two means was quantified in terms of Cohen’s d where values
<0.30 reflect a small effect size, values from 0.30 to 0.80 reflect a medium effect size,
and values >0.80 reflect a large effect size78. All data analyses were conducted using
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 25.083. Fieldwork and data collection was
conducted by the survey company Qualtrics, which has completed more than
15,000 projects across 2500 universities worldwide. The data was generated using
Qualtrics software, Version – March 202084.

Finally, the vaccine accepting, hesitant, and resistant groups were compared
with respect to where they source their information about COVID-19, and the level
of trust they have in these information sources. These comparisons were made
using one-way between-groups ANOVA tests with Bonferroni post-hoc tests.
