Diabetes and COVID-19: Risks,
Management, and Learnings From
Other National Disasters
Diabetes Care 2020;43:1695–1703 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-1192
Evidence relating to the impact of COVID-19 in people with diabetes (PWD) is limited
but continuing to emerge. PWD appear to be at increased risk ofmore severe COVID19 infection, though evidence quantifying the risk is highly uncertain. The extent to
which clinical and demographic factorsmoderate this relationship is unclear, though
signals are emerging that link higher BMI and higher HbA1c to worse outcomes in
PWD with COVID-19. As well as posing direct immediate risks to PWD, COVID-19 also
risks contributing to worse diabetes outcomes due to disruptions caused by the
pandemic, including stress and changes to routine care, diet, and physical activity.
Countries have used various strategies to support PWD during this pandemic. There
is a high potential for COVID-19 to exacerbate existing health disparities, and
research and practice guidelines need to take this into account. Evidence on the
management of long-term conditions during national emergencies suggests various
ways to mitigate the risks presented by these events.
People with diabetes (PWD) have been identified as being at increased risk of serious
illness from COVID-19. COVID-19 also presents substantial indirect risks to PWD
through disruptions in health care and lifestyle factors. Understanding these risks and
best ways to mitigate them in the short and longer term is key to facilitating informed
decision-making during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Evidence relating to COVID-19 and diabetes is limited but continuing to emerge.
In this Perspective, we summarize evidence identified through rapid reviews. We
consider direct and indirect risks posed to PWD by COVID-19 and management
considerations for PWD both with and without COVID-19 infection. Recognizing
limitations in evidence related to COVID-19, we also bring together leaders in diabetes
care from countries with high rates of COVID-19, highlighting experiences from the
most affected countries including Italy, France, China, the U.K., and the U.S.
DIABETES AND RISKS FROM COVID-19
COVID-19 Infection: Contracting the Disease
It is unclear if PWD are more likely to contract COVID-19. PWD are considered at
increased risk of infection generally, which has been extended to COVID-19 (1).
Community testing for COVID-19 remains limited; hence, data predominantly come
from hospitalized cohorts. Systematic reviews primarily consisting of data from China
have estimated rates of 8% (95% CI 6–11%) (2), 7.87% (95% CI 6.57–9.28%) (3), and
9.7% (95% CI 6.9–12.5%) (4) of diabetes in people hospitalized with COVID-19. The
percentage hospitalization appears higher in the U.S., where from February 12 to 28
March 2020, PWD accounted for 10.9% of all COVID-19 patients (similar to the proportion
of the U.S. population with diabetes), 24% of hospitalized cases (non–intensive care unit

DIABETES AND COVID-19
[ICU]), and 32% of ICU admissions (5). A
recent (preprint) U.K. study found uncomplicated diabetes to be the second most
common comorbidity (19%) in patients
hospitalized with COVID-19; complicated
diabetes is reported in a figure only but
prevalence looks to be approximately
6.5% (6).
COVID-19 Infection: Disease Severity
Though issues with study quality and
imprecision make it extremely difficult
to quantify, current data suggest that
COVID-19 is associated with worse outcomes in PWD. Reports that aggregate
data from multiple centers are summarized
in Table 1. There is a notable paucity of data
on what moderates the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 severity.
Increased age, being male, hypertension, and cardiovascular comorbidities
are associated with increased risks for
COVID-19 severity (7) and are likely to
be closely related to diabetes status. It is
plausible that BMI (8), ethnicity (9), type
of diabetes, diabetes control, and certain medications (10) all may also play a
role. In two cohort studies (France and the
U.K., U.K. study preprint) in PWD hospitalized with COVID-19, higher BMI was positively associated with worse COVID-19
outcomes when compared with people
with BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2 (11,12). Data on
diabetes type and COVID-19 outcomes
are only beginning to emerge, but preliminary (not yet peer reviewed) data
from England (see Table 1) suggest risks
may be higher in people with type 1
diabetes compared with type 2 (though
risk was increased in all PWD regardless
of type) (12). Data on glucose control and
COVID-19 outcomes are discussed below.
Association Between Blood Glucose
Control and COVID-19 Outcomes
There are limited data to date on the
association between blood glucose control and COVID-19 outcomes. A retrospective study of 451 people with COVID-19
with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia
from the U.S. reported that people with
uncontrolled hyperglycemia had longer
length of stay and higher mortality compared with people without diabetes or
uncontrolled hyperglycemia (13). Another
retrospective study of people with type 2
diabetes from China reported that wellcontrolled blood glucose correlated with
improved outcomes in infected patients
(14). Worse infection may predispose to
more difficulty managing blood glucose,
so the causal mechanism behind correlations between glucose control and worse
COVID-19 outcomes is unclear.

1696 Diabetes and COVID-19 Diabetes Care Volume 43, August 2020
Two recent U.K. studies (both preprint)
reported that diabetes was independently
associated with a higher risk of death
that increased with higher HbA1c (12,15).
Compared with people without diabetes,
one study reported that PWD with HbA1c
.7.5% (58 mmol/mol) had a higher
chance of in-hospital death than those
with HbA1c ,7.5% (,7.5% HR 1.50 [95%
CI 1.40–1.60], $7.5% HR 2.36 [2.18–
2.56]) (15). In a separate analysis, PWD
with HbA1c .10% (86 mmol/mol) had a
higher risk of in-hospital death related to
COVID-19 than those with an HbA1c of
6.5–7% (48–53 mmol/mol) (HbA1c .10%
compared with HbA1c 6.5–7% adjusted
HR 2.19 [95% CI 1.46–3.29] for type 1
diabetes, 1.62 [95% CI 1.48–1.79] for
type 2; in patients with type 2 diabetes,
a significant difference was also detected
when comparing HbA1c values .7.5%
[59 mmol/mol] to the reference category) (12). These data suggest that diabetes control preinfection has a role to
play in COVID-19 outcomes. In contrast, a
French observational study in PWD hospitalized with COVID-19 did not find an
association between long-term glucose
control and COVID-19 outcomes but had
a smaller sample (11).
Indirect Risks to PWD Posed by
COVID-19
Health care services, and in some cases
access to medication and supplies, have
been disrupted by COVID-19. Evidence
from other national emergencies shows
that such disruptions can lead to worse
diabetes outcomes during and after these
events (16–18). Diet and physical activity
aremainstaysofdiabetes self-management
and can reduce risk of worse outcomes in
PWDand thosewith cardiometabolicmultimorbidities (19). Though yet to be addressed by the COVID-19 literature, the
pandemic presents significant disruption
to both: a U.S. survey of PWD found more
than a third of respondents reported
their diet is now less healthy, and half
report exercising less (20). The current
pandemic and social isolation are likely to
increase rates of anxiety and depression,
whichmay also lead to poor adherence to
medications and worsening of risk factor
control (21,22).
MANAGING DIABETES DURING THE
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Reducing Risk from COVID-19
There is little evidence on how PWD can
reduce their risk during the COVID-19
pandemic beyond following general infection control guidance within each
country. More frequent blood glucose
monitoring (in people who self-monitor)
has been suggested, though it is unclear
what evidence was used to make these
recommendations (1).
Considerations for Diabetes
Management in All PWD
Figure 1 summarizes specific considerations for diabetes management during
national emergencies.
Self-management
There is little information on the effectiveness of self-management/self-education
during the pandemic. A variety of online
services have been implemented but
have yet to be assessed (see EXPERIENCES
FROM COUNTRIES WITH HIGH RATES OF COVID-19).
The wider literature on care of long-term
conditions during national emergencies
suggests a role for educational materials
(23). Evidence for interventions aiming
to optimize self-management in PWD
that are potentially feasible in disaster
contexts include mobile phone apps (24),
web- or computer-based interventions
(25), text messaging (26,27), and selfmonitoring of blood glucose (28,29).
The latter two show the most promise
based on the available literature. However, the interventions tested may not
be widely available or may require health
care resources to be set up. In addition,
choice of format should be tailored to
patient preferences, which will vary by
age and sociodemographic group (30).
Diabetes Services
Guidelines for routine diabetes care during
the COVID-19 pandemic vary by country.
Themes are summarized in Table 2. Studies
of remote consultations have generally
found positive results, though their generalizability to the current pandemic may
be limited (31). Within diabetes, there is
little evidence to support or oppose remote support (32,33).
Mental Health and Diabetes-Related Distress
There are overarching concerns about
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
mental health and well-being (34,35).
PWD are more prone to mental health
issues than the general population (36).
Adherence to treatment can worsen
when people are distressed or have depression (21), as seen both during and
after disasters (37,38). We found no evidence directly pertaining to management
of diabetes-related anxiety or distress
during this pandemic. In the general
literature, there is mixed evidence on
interventions to reduce diabetes-related
distress, and the vast majority of interventions tested involve face-to-face
contactdan unsuitable format in the
current context (39).
Managing COVID-19 in PWD
Management of PWD with COVID-19
generally follows standard sick-day rules.
Considerations that may be specific to
COVID-19 are summarized below.
Medication
Most COVID-19–related consensus statements recommend stopping metformin
and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) during acute illness and
following the sick-day rules. Dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA),and insulinare the preferred options
in particular for hospitalized patients
(see Fig. 2) (40,41). There has been some
discussion regarding use of ACE inhibitors
and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
being associated with worse outcomes in
COVID-19, particularly in PWD. However,
in view of data showing potential benefits, the current recommendation is to
continue with these therapies (40).
A number of studies are currently
testing chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine
for prevention or management of COVID-19.
Careful glucose monitoring will be required in PWD due to these drugs’ antidiabetic properties, with the potential
risk of hypoglycemia that is associated
with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia, cardiovascular events, and mortality (42).
Management in Hospital
Guidance emphasizes the importance of
referring to local specialist diabetes teams
and of managing hyperglycemia (43). A
narrative review suggests insulin is the
preferred agent for control of hyperglycemia in this context (1). In the U.S., a
major early focus for hospital management was to move inpatient care for PWD
to “virtual” formats where possible, to
reduce the need for personal protective
equipment. This included use of electronic
health records to interrogate data, telephone communication between diabetes
care providers and inpatients and hospital
staff, expanded “diabetes self-management
protocols” allowing selected inpatients to
monitor their own glucose and self-administer
care.diabetesjournals.org Hartmann-Boyce and Associates 1697
insulin with oversight and advice from
the virtual care team, and, in some
institutions, initiating inpatient continuous
glucose monitoring and/or flash systems.
To minimize the need for ICU beds, several
institutions launched subcutaneous insulin
protocols for the treatment of diabetic
ketoacidosis on floors with adequate nursing staffing. Virtual diabetes care teams
focused on supporting transitions to lower
levels of care or outpatient settings.
EXPERIENCES FROM COUNTRIES
WITH HIGH RATES OF COVID-19
We summarize here experiences from
five countries that have had significant
COVID-19 outbreaks.
China
During the outbreak in China, many PWD
were unable to access health care providers (HCPs) or medical supplies due to
stay-at-home orders or quarantine. Hospitals reduced the number of appointments drastically. To mitigate the impact
of those changes on diabetes management, several organizations issued guidance to PWD on how to cope with the
situation (44,45). The guidance developed by the Chinese Geriatric Endocrine
Society mainly focused on prevention
and early discovery of hyperglycemic crises and management of medications and
provided detailed instructions on how to
get access to certified internet-based
medical services through smartphones
(45). If PWD urgently needed to see an
HCP in hospital, detailed guidance on
how to prepare for consultations before
leaving home and minimize exposure to
the virus were given en route and during
the hospital visit. Guidance was promoted in the form of reading material
and lectures given by medical professionals through internet-based public media
such as Baidu Health (an equivalent of
Google in China) and the WeChat mobile
app. An expert recommendation on insulin treatment of hyperglycemia in patients
affected with COVID-19 was developed
(46).
France
On 12 March, President Macron ordered
most people to stay at home, especially
“at-risk” groups, including PWD. Many
PWD were struck by the announcement
and were not expecting to be publicly
identified as such, without answers to
basic questions. On 18 March, a group of
HCPs and researchers from the Federation of Diabetology launched a web app,
CoviDIAB, to provide PWD with diabetesspecific, scientifically based information
and to provide support. This free service
includes access to a frequently updated
media library and to live webinars with
nurses, physicians, and experts. Twice a
week, registrants also receive short questionnaires about COVID-19 symptoms and
tests for anxiety/depression. If indicated,
registrants automatically receive a notice suggesting medical contact, and
phone calls may follow. At the time of
writing, tens of thousands of patients
were registered. Empathy was a driving
principle in design, and comments suggest that the service helps people to
understand and self-manage their individual risk and to limit disruption in
lifestyle and care. An evaluation will
indicate to what extent it reduces the
burden of disease. Recommendations
have been formulated by the Frenchspeaking Diabetes Society (Societ´ e´
Francophone du Diabete) to promote `
the intensification of glycemic control
by remote support by professionals
and frequent self-monitoring. However, extremely limited evidence was
available to guide both patients and
HCPs. In response, a group of physicians
and researchers from 50 French hospitals
designed and launched a large register
to collect data on PWD hospitalized with
COVID-19 and their prognosis (COVID-19
and Diabetes Outcomes [CORONADO],
NCT04324736, ClinicalTrials.gov). Recruitment has exceeded expectation; early
results are now available (11).
Italy
The first cases COVID-19 in Italy were
recorded early in February. Tragically,
Italy has suffered among the highest
numbers of deaths in the world (47). At
the time of this writing, the death rate in
Italy was estimated at 122.52 per 1,000
infections, i.e., a 10-fold higher rate than
in Germany (14.14 per 1,000 infections)
(48). This could be due to demographic
features of the Italian population, which
include a large proportion (23%) of people aged $65 years (49). From 9 March,
social confinement rules were issued includ-ing restricted access to outpatient
clinics. Access to diabetes clinics has
been limited to urgent cases, and remote
contacts via telephone or video teleconsultation have been officially approved
and reimbursed by the National Health
System. Prescriptions of glucose-lowering
agents requiring specialist approval
(DPP-4i, SGLT2i, GLP-1RA, and new basal
insulin analogs) were automatically renewed until the end of May. Special joint
recommendations have been promptly
issued by the Italian Society of Diabetes
(SID), the Association of Italian Diabetologists (AMD), the Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), and the Italian Society
of Pediatric Endocrinology (SIEDP) (50).
The same organizations have opened a
Facebook page entitled “One hour with
Self-/remote

diabetes.
1698 Diabetes and COVID-19 Diabetes Care Volume 43, August 2020
AMD, SID, and SIEDP” allowing PWD and
their relatives to contact specialists (51).
A government web page providing simple and pragmatic recommendations has
been created focusing on disruptions to
physical activity and diet as a result of
social confinement (52). At the time of
writing, discussions were ongoing regarding restarting clinical activities
and how to organize post-COVID diabetes clinics.
U.K.
Over 90% of PWD in the U.K. are managed
in primary care, by enhanced diabetesskilled primary care physicians, nurses,
and health care assistants. These models
have shown to be effective in reducing
hospitalizations, outpatient attendance,
and admissions for diabetes-related
complications (53). In March, the government issued guidance on social distancing and self-isolation (54). In England,
people considered especially clinically vulnerable (including some but
not all PWD) were contacted by the
government with advice on shielding.
All people at high risk, including PWD,
were advised to only leave the house
for limited periods for essential shopping and one form of exercise (55). The
Primary Care Diabetes Society and the
Association of British Clinical Diabetologists have issued guidance on managing
PWD in primary care (56). The national
charity Diabetes UK has been active in
giving advice to PWD through their website and social media. Both primary and
secondary care are providing emergency
and routine follow-up using telephone or
video consultations including support for
mental well-being, though there are some
regional variations. Social media channels
have been set up where HCPs are sharing
experience in managing people in the
community and hospital and exchanging
new guidance. A number of self-managementeducation programs have beenmade
freely available. There are also discussions regarding longer-term plans to
phase in face-to-face consultations for
routine chronic disease management.
U.S.
The lack of universal health coverage
poses additional challenges to PWD and
their care providers during the COVID-19
pandemic in the U.S. There has been an
almost wholesale switch to virtual care
for outpatient appointments, but there
aremany failings in this approach. Phone
visits provide a much lower rate of reimbursement than video visits, but many
of the most vulnerable patients have
inadequate equipment or connectivity to
support video visits. Contacts with certified diabetes educators by phone or
video are not reimbursed. Additional
efforts have been made to communicate
with PWD at home to ensure that they
are safe. Laboratory and physical exam
monitoring of complications has virtually ceased for most patients as long
as they symptomatically remain well.
Table 2—Selection of guidance and recommendations relating to routine care in PWD during COVID-19 pandemic
Service Recommendations
Inpatient diabetes services c Inpatient diabetes services will need to continue and potentially increase capacity, with need for
team approach re: glycemic control and nutritional status, and consideration of “virtual visits” for
reviews (see MANAGEMENT IN HOSPITAL) (68).
Urgent/acute diabetes care (outpatient) c Face-to-face consultations should continue in the following circumstances: a new diagnosis of
T1D; urgent insulin start where symptomatic, HbA1c .10% (86 mmol/mol), or ketones detected;
teaching blood glucose monitoring for urgent reasons; or in cases where physical examination is
essential (e.g., foot ulcer, infection, some points in pregnancy) (69).
c Virtual (telephone, video, or e-mail) consultations should be used in the following circumstances:
follow-up of new T1D diagnoses; vulnerable patients (recent hospital admission, recurrent severe
hypoglycemia, HbA1c .11% [99 mmol/mol]); intensive follow-up in high-risk situations; or where
risk of attending an appointment face-to-face is greater than the benefits (69).*
Routine diabetes care c Consider routine diabetes care delivered virtually in the context of broader long-term condition
management and prioritization, taking into account individual risk factors and clinical needs (68).
c The following should be deferred: routine appointments where diabetes is stable and wellmanaged; face-to-face structured group education courses; flash glucose monitoring start
sessions; where the risk of attending an appointment is greater than the benefits; and where
deferring appointments will not compromise clinical care (69).
Foot services for PWD c May need to continueat full capacitywith consideration ofmoving support to remote forms where
possible (68); many of these services are essential (70).
c Access to in-person support should continue for those with acute or limb-threatening problems
(70) or where physical examination is essential (69).
c All new referrals should ideally be reviewed within 24 h (70).
Pregnancy services for PWD c May need to continueat full capacitywith consideration ofmoving support to remote forms where
possible (68).
c In-person support will be essential for physical examinations and/or teaching blood glucose
monitoring at some points in pregnancy (69).
Blood tests for PWD c Urgent blood testmonitoring should continue (e.g., declining renal function, raised potassium, low
sodium) (69).
Eye screening for PWD c This was not mentioned in the guidance reviewed but we understand in most affected countries
eye screening has been halted in view of high risk of transfer. Of note, evidence indicates that risk
stratifying is possible (71).
*PWD may be concerned about the need to visit hospital; they should be encouraged to contact their physician in case of any signs or symptoms
related to acute diabetes complications.
care.diabetesjournals.org Hartmann-Boyce and Associates 1699
Many patients have lost insurance coverage. Prescription fills for diabetes medications are down 10%; a survey of PWD
found one in six respondents needing
insulin experienced a problem. A similar
proportion reported issues with obtaining test strips, and a quarter of respondents reported issues with obtaining
pump or continuous glucose monitoring
supplies (20). Many pharmaceutical
companies have stepped in to increase
access to otherwise unaffordable medications. In data available through the
end of March, relatively early in the U.S.
COVID-19 course, approximately 80% of
clinicians reported serious strain and
nearly two-thirds were uncertain whether
they would be able to keep their practices
open due to insufficient financial resources
and low volume of reimbursable work.
Overall visits (virtual and face-to-face) for
chronic asymptomatic care were down
;50% (57). As the future course of the
epidemic in theU.S. is uncertain and seems
likely to persist for many weeks, the threat
to PWD is grave. The hope is that new
government initiatives and innovation on
the part of stakeholders will fill the
emerging cracks in an already fragmented system.
CONSIDERATIONS FOR
MANAGEMENT OF LONG-TERM
CONDITIONS DURING NATIONAL
EMERGENCIES
Evidence on the management of longterm conditions during national emergencies suggests various ways tomitigate
the risks presented by these events,
which predominantly fall under two phases:
planning and response (23). These strategies are outlined in Table 3.
AFTER COVID-19
There is much uncertainty as to how the
COVID-19 pandemic will end and what
will be left in its wake. Disruptions that
arise due to national emergencies can
lead to increased HbA1c in those affected
up to 16 months later, with some evidence that this is particularly the case for
people of lower socioeconomic status
and those treated with insulin (18,23). A
lack of access to routine health care is a
leading cause of morbidity and mortality
after disasters; stroke, acute myocardial
infarctions, and diabetes complications are all shown to increase after the
immediate threat has dissipated (26,58).
Services such as diabetes clinics may also
rethink their organization to minimize risk
of ongoing transmission.
CONCLUSIONS
The need for decisive action creates an
important tension when evidence is limited. An example here is the classification
of PWD as being at increased risk from
COVID-19 and therefore subject to increased preventive measures. Though
risk is clearly increased, quantification is
scant. There is little to no evidence on
potentially moderating factors, despite
the fact that these data are routinely
collected in data sets used for existing
analyses; the results presented are often
unadjusted and use single disease categories, ignoring potential differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes and
multimorbidities, which are associated
with worse outcomes (59).

the literature as it relates to other national emergencies. This latter source of
evidence shows the toll of disruptions to
diabetes care is often most pronounced
after the acute phase of the emergency
or disaster has passed. In some cases, the
excess morbidity and mortality in the
aftermath of national emergencies is
higher than the toll during the emergency itself. History issues a stark warning here when considering the balance
between diverting resources toward the
acute COVID-19 crisis and maintaining
routine care for people living with longterm conditions.
Finally, in reviewing what has been
written on the topic of diabetes and
COVID-19, we have been struck by two
noticeable absences. The first is the
absence of literature on wider contextual
factors. PWD are likely to be impacted by
COVID-19 just as much outside the health
care setting as within it, with particular
concerns relating to disruptions to diet
and physical activity, increased stress,
and burdens on mental health and
well-being, yet the literature to date focuses almost exclusively on clinical management. The other unspoken issue in the
literature we reviewed is that of inequality.
COVID-19 is not an equal-opportunity disease. The burden will disproportionally be
borne by people from less-advantaged
groups (60). Emerging data also suggest
that COVID-19 may pose more of a risk
to nonwhite ethnic groups (9). Diabetes
discriminates in similar ways, and the
intersection of diabetes and COVID-19
creates a maelstrom in which existing
health disparities risk exacerbation with
profound and long-lasting consequences.
COVID-19 holds a mirror to our health care
systems and care of PWD; may we do all
we can now to make that reflection favorable in hindsight.
