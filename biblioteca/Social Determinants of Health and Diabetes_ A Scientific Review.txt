Social Determinants of Health and
Diabetes: A Scientific Review
Diabetes Care 2021;44:258–279 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dci20-0053
Decades of research have demonstrated that diabetes affects racial and ethnic minority and low-income adult populations in the U.S. disproportionately, with relatively
intractable patterns seen in these populations’ higher risk of diabetes and rates of
diabetes complications and mortality (1). With a health care shift toward greater
emphasis on population health outcomes and value-based care, social determinants of
health (SDOH) have risen to the forefront as essential intervention targets to achieve
health equity (2–4). Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted unequal
vulnerabilities borne by racial and ethnic minority groups and by disadvantaged
communities. In the wake of concurrent pandemic and racial injustice events in the
U.S., the American College of Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, Society of
General Internal Medicine, National Academy of Medicine, and other professional
organizations have published statements on SDOH (5–8), and calls to action focus on
amelioration of these determinants at individual, organizational, and policy levels (9–11).
In diabetes, understanding and mitigating the impact of SDOH are priorities due to
disease prevalence, economic costs, and disproportionate population burden (12–14). In
2013, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) published a scientific statement on
socioecological determinants of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (15). Toward the goal of
understanding and advancing opportunities for health improvement among the population
with diabetes through addressing SDOH, ADA convened the current SDOH and diabetes
writing committee, prepandemic, to review the literature on 1) associations of SDOH
with diabetes risk and outcomes and 2) impact of interventions targeting amelioration
of SDOH on diabetes outcomes. This article begins with an overview of key definitions
and SDOH frameworks. The literature review focuses primarily on U.S.-based studies of
adults with diabetes and on five SDOH: socioeconomic status (education, income,
occupation); neighborhood and physical environment (housing, built environment,
toxic environmental exposures); food environment (food insecurity, food access);
health care (access, affordability, quality); and social context (social cohesion, social
capital, social support). This review concludes with recommendations for linkages across
health care and community sectors from national advisory committees, recommendations for diabetes research, and recommendations for research to inform practice.
DEFINITIONS OF HEALTH DISPARITIES, HEALTH EQUITY, AND SDOH
Table 1 displays definitions of key terms. Differences in diabetes risk and outcomes can
result from multiple contributors, including biological, clinical, and nonclinical factors
(1). A substantial body of scientific literature demonstrates the adverse impact of a
particular type of difference, health disparities (16) in diabetes (1,17,18). A preponderance of health disparities research in the U.S. has examined disparities by race
and ethnicity (3,19). Internationally, the term health equity has traditionally been
used to encompass the range of population inequalities resulting from demographic
and economic characteristics, and this term is used increasingly in the U.S. (20–24).
Addressing healthy equity necessitates an understanding of social and environmental
factors that combined account for 50% to 60% of health outcomes (22,25). These
social and environmental factors collectively are known as SDOH (21,26,27).

SCIENTIFIC REVIEW
County Health Rankings Model (31,32),
and Kaiser Family Foundation Social Determinants of Health factors (33).
No single consensus set of factors define SDOH. Nomenclatures used by each
framework, for shared SDOH factors, are
depicted in Fig. 1. Common among the
frameworks is placement of economic
and socioeconomic determinants as foremost. Food SDOH factors (e.g., insecurity
and access) are classified as economic
stability (29), neighborhood and built
environment (29), material circumstances (28), or as an independent category
(33). Housing is classified as material
circumstances (28), economic stability
(29), or neighborhood and built environment (33). Environmental exposures
(i.e., toxins, air pollution, and water
quality) are classified as neighborhood
and physical environment (31) or built
environment (29). Social environment is
represented as community and societal
context (29,33), social cohesion and social capital (28), or social factors (31).
Health care is a SDOH in the WHO,
Healthy People 2020, and County Health
Rankings models, with access factors as
primary, with or without quality of care
factors.
Each framework posits complex interactions among SDOH factors. WHO additionally maps causal priority among
the determinants. For example, the upstream sociopolitical context and resulting socioeconomic position are root
cause, structural determinants of health
inequities that work through intermediary sets of determinants to cause health
inequities. WHO positions the health
system as an SDOH that plays a role in
mediating impact of intermediary determinants on health outcomes (28).
REVIEW OF SDOH AND DIABETES
SDOH inclusion in this review was determined by representation within one or
more existing SDOH frameworks and
presence of a sufficient body of literature
to demonstrate influence of the determinant on diabetes. The reviewed SDOH
are shown in Table 2. Studies of primarily adult populations are described, and
the terms type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM),
and “diabetes” (indicating either a mixed
T2DM and T1DM sample or diabetes case
ascertainment methods that do not enable specifying clinical diagnostic type)
are used in accordance with the terminology used in the respective studies.
Socioeconomic Status and Diabetes
Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multidimensional construct that includes educational, economic, and occupational status
(34–36). SES is a consistently strong predictor of disease onset and progression at
all levels of SES for many diseases, including diabetes (37). SES is linked to
virtually all of the established SDOH. It is
associated with the extent to which individuals and communities can access
material resources including health care,
housing, transportation, and nutritious food
and social resources such as political power,
social engagement, and control.
The three components of SES are intercorrelated (38), but each aspect has
unique implications for health. Each component can be assessed at the individual
or population level (39). For example,
economic status is often measured by
determining a person’s own income.
However, it is also assessed by the income of the household in which the
person resides and by the income level
of the community (e.g., mean household
income of the census track in which a
person resides) as a proxy for the individual’s household income. Census-level
household income also operates as a
contextual variable, reflecting the composition and available resources in a defined area.
Educational status can be quantified
either in years of schooling or highest
degree earned. It may be assessed at the
level of the individual (e.g., the person’s
own educational attainment), the household (the highest grade completed by
anyone in the household), or the community (e.g., percent of high school or
college graduates in a census track).
Quantity of education does not capture
differences in quality of education that
may be relevant to SES measurement
(38). Literacy has emerged as a measure
of educational quality and as potentially
more reflective of SES than years of
schooling among African Americans and
Table 1—Definitions
Term Definition
Health disparities A particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental
disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically
experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic
status; sex; age; mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical disability; sexual orientation or gender
identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion
(16).
Health equity Equity is the absence of avoidable, unfair, or remediable differences among groups of people, whether
those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically or by other
means of stratification. “Health equity” or “equity in health” implies that ideally everyone should
have a fair opportunity to attain their full health potential and that no one should be disadvantaged
from achieving this potential (24).
Health equity is attainment of the highest level of health for all people. Achieving health equity requires
valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing societal efforts to address avoidable inequalities,
historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health and health care disparities (23).
Social determinants of health (SDOH) The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.
These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global,
national, and local levels. The social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health
inequitiesdthe unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries
(26).

low-income Whites (40,41). Health literacy, which is directly associated with
literacy and is context specific (42–44),
and literacy are included as SDOH in
Healthy People 2020 (29).
Occupation is itself multidimensional.
It has been measured as employment
status (e.g., employed vs. unemployed),
stability (e.g., job insecurity), job type
(e.g., manual vs. nonmanual, prestige of
the occupation), and working conditions
(e.g., shift work, number of hours worked,
job demands, and control) (39,45). For
members of large organizations, occupational hierarchies of job titles capture
work conditions as well as qualifications
and pay (e.g., civil service grades).
Associations of SESWith Diabetes Incidence,
Prevalence, and Outcomes
Income, education, and occupation show
a graded association with diabetes prevalence and complications across all levels
of SES, up to the very top. Those lower on
the SES ladder are more likely to develop
T2DM, experience more complications,
and die sooner than those higher up
on the SES ladder (46,47). The higher a
person’s income, the greater their educational attainment, and the higher their
occupational grade, the less likely they
are to develop T2DM or to experience its
complications. The gradient is steeper at
the bottom, however, and research has
focusedprimarilyon thosewith the lowest
levels of income and education.
Income. Prevalence of diabetes increases
on a gradient from highest to lowest
income (48,49). In data from the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) covering
2011–2014, Beckles and Chou (50) found
increasing diabetes prevalence at lower
levels of income as reflected in the levels
of ratio of income to poverty level. Compared with those with high income, the
relative percentage difference in prevalence of diabetes for those classified as
middle income, near poor, and poor, was
40.0%, 74.1%, and 100.4%, respectively.
The difference in diabetes prevalence by
income was greater during this time period than it had been in a prior period
(1999–2002), pointing to widening disparities in diabetes prevalence associated
with income.
At the neighborhood level, differences
in diabetes prevalence by census track
are attributable to SES (51,52). For example, in a recent study by Kolak et al.
(52), rate of T2DM was found to be
significantly higher and concentrated in
census tracts characterized by factors including lower incomes, lower high school
graduation rates,moresingle-parenthouseholds, and crowded housing. Living in
neighborhood census tracts with lower
educational attainment, lower annual
income, and larger percentage of households receiving Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program benefits has been

associated with higher risk of progression to T2DM among adults with prediabetes (53).
Gaskin et al. (49) examined the interaction of individual poverty with neighborhood poverty and found that, compared
with nonpoor adults living in nonpoor
neighborhoods, poor adults living in
nonpoor neighborhoods have increased
odds of having diabetes, and poor adults
living in poor neighborhoods have twofold higher odds of having diabetes. In
addition, a race-poverty-place gradient
was observed. Compared with nonpoor
Whites in nonpoor neighborhoods, odds
of diabetes were highest for poor Whites
in poor neighborhoods (odds ratio [OR]
2.51, 95% CI 5 1.31–4.81), followed by
poor Blacks in poor neighborhoods and
nonpoor Blacks in poor neighborhoods
(OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.50–4.01, and OR 2.49,
95% CI 1.48–4.19), and finally poorWhites
in nonpoor neighborhoods (OR 1.73, 95%
CI 1.16–2.57) (49).
Adults with T2DM who have a family
income below the federal poverty level
have a twofold higher risk of diabetesrelated mortality compared with their
counterparts in the highest family income levels (54). This pattern of diabetes-related mortality has been observed
specifically in adults with T1DM as well
(55). A meta-analysis by Bijlsma-Rutte
et al. (56) observed an inverse association
between income and HbA1c levels in
people with T2DM, with a pooled mean
difference in HbA1cof 0.20% (95% CI20.05
to 0.46) between people with low and high
income. Low income is associated with a
higher risk of experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis among youth and adults with T1DM
(57) and with higher HbA1c levels, particularly among racial/ethnic minority youth
with lower SES (58,59).
Education. Age-adjusted incidence of diagnosed diabetes in adults is associated
also with educational level in a stepwise
pattern. Diabetes incidence is highest
(10.4 per 1,000 persons) for adults
with less than a high school education,
7.8 per 1,000 persons for those with a
terminal high school education, and 5.3
per 1,000 persons for those with more
than a high school education (60). Diabetes prevalence in the adult U.S. population is similarly inversely associated
with educational level in a stepwise pattern. In the U.S., the age-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed diabetes is 12.6%
for those with less than a high school
education, 9.5% for those with a high
school education, and 7.2% for those
with more than a high school education
(61). Having a college education or more
is associated with the lowest odds of
diabetes (62). Mirroring findings on income, temporal trends in diabetes prevalence at different levels of education
show increasing disparities in prevalence
associated with educational attainment
(50).
The risk of diabetes-related mortality
demonstrates a gradient from lowest to
highest education level. Compared with
adults with a college degree or higher,
having less than high school education is
associated with a twofold higher mortality from diabetes (relative hazard 2.05,
95% CI 1.78–2.35) (54). In adults with
T1DM, not having a college degree is
associated with a threefold higher mortality from diabetes compared with counterparts with a college degree (63). Lower
educational level is associated with higher
HbA1c, with a meta-analysis (56) reporting
a pooled mean difference in HbA1c of
0.26% (95% CI, 0.09–0.43) between people with low and high educational levels.
Regarding literacy/health literacy as a
SDOH, Marciano et al. (64) conducted a
meta-analysis of 61 studies of 18,905
adults with T1DM or T2DM to determine
associations of health literacy with several diabetes outcomes and found that
higher levels of health literacy were significantly associated with lower HbA1c
levels and better diabetes knowledge,
but not with more frequent self-management activities.
Occupation.Systematic reviews and metaanalyses have examined several aspects
of occupation in relation to diabetes risk,
although most of this research has been
conducted outside of the U.S. Ferrie et al.
(65) conducted a meta-analysis of associations of job insecurity with incident
diabetes and found an association of high
job insecurity with higher risk of incident
diabetes (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09–1.30). A
meta-analysis by Varanka-Ruuska et al.
(66) found that unemployment was associated with increased odds of both
prediabetes (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.07–
2.35) and T2DM (OR 1.72, 95% CI
1.14–2.58). Exposure to shift work is
associated with higher risk of diabetes
than working normal daytime schedules
(67). A meta-analysis by Kivimaki et al. ¨
(68) reported an association of long work
hours ($55 h per week) as compared
with standard work hours (35–40 h per
week) with higher incident diabetes in
adults with low SES but not in adults with
high SES. A U.S. population-based survey
on diabetes and occupation found highest prevalence of diabetes among transportation workers and lowest prevalence
of diabetes among physicians (69,70).
SES Interventions and Diabetes Outcomes
To date, there is no body of literature
describing impact of change in income,
change to higher educational status, or
different employment/occupational status on diabetes outcomes, although income and wage changes, and job changes
and loss, do occur naturalistically. Similarly, no diabetes outcomes have been
reported from interventions directly targeting living wages, early childhood education, educational quality, or educational
access for poor children and families.
Studies have examined diabetes selfmanagement interventions in the setting
of low literacy/health literacy, particularly among racial/ethnic minority adults
with T2DM and have demonstrated effectiveness of low-literacy adaptions (71)
and health literacy and numeracy tools in
improving diabetes knowledge and selfcare (72–74). A meta-analysis of nine
intervention trials with 1,874 adults
with T2DM found that literacy-sensitive
interventions wereassociatedwitha small
but statistically significant decrease in
HbA1c (–0.18%; 95% CI –0.36 to –0.004)
in comparison with usual clinical care (75)
in patients regardless of health literacy
status. Literacy-adapted education and
tools may need to be combined with
more comprehensive evidence-based behavioral self-management intervention
approaches to achieve substantive clinical
improvements in racial/ethnic minority
populations with T2DM and low literacy/health literacy (76,77). In conclusion,
despite the long-standingevidence for SES
as a key determinant both of diabetes risk
and outcomes, systematic investigation of
impact on diabetes of change in SES
remains a gap in the literature.
Neighborhood and Physical
Environment and Diabetes
The neighborhood environment in which
one lives has been of major interest as a
setting in which to understand contextual and multilevel influences on health
(78).DiezRouxandMair (78)havedescribed
the role of historical and contemporary
care.diabetesjournals.org Hill-Briggs and Associates 261
residential segregation by race, ethnicity,
and SES as the socioeconomic and political
context that produced the patterns of unequal resource distribution resulting in
neighborhood environments that maintain
health inequities. Tung et al. (79) also
discuss the multiple intricacies associated
with how race, place, and poverty converge in a dynamic way across various
spatial contexts and circumstances to
influence health and propose that understanding the intersection of these
contextual influences is needed to prevent diabetes inequities. Neighborhood
and physical environment factors of
housing, built environment, and environmental exposures are reviewed.
Housing
Stable housing is a key indicator of economic stability (80) and a core SDOH (80).
Housing instability refers to a spectrum
of situations that can range from living
in one’s car, staying with relatives or
friends, having trouble paying rent, suffering evictions or frequent moves, paying more than 50% of income in rent,
and living in crowded conditions (historically defined as having more than one
person per room) to homelessnessdthe
most extreme form of unstable housing
(81–85). Homelessness is defined as
“lacking a regular nighttime residence
or having a primary nighttime residence
that is a temporary shelter or other
place not designed for sleeping” (86).
As of 2020, theU.S. government reported
567,715 or 17 of 10,000 people in the
country are homeless; African Americans
accounted for 40% of people experiencing homelessness, while those identifying as Hispanic or Latino comprised 22%
of the homeless population (87). A common theme in conceptual models linking
housing instability to poor health is that
the instability inherent to the situation
makes it difficult to attend to preventive
services and self-care (83,88–90), leading
to worse control of chronic conditions,
higher use of acute-care services like
emergency departments, and higher likelihood of complications (91–93).
Associations of Housing Instability With Diabetes Incidence, Prevalence, and Outcomes. The
prevalence of diabetes among those with
housing instability in the U.S., and whether
it differs from that among those without
housing instability, is not known. A key
limitation for the field is that there is
no single, accepted definition of housing
instability or a commonly used assessment instrument. Further, because housing instability is more likely to occur
among individuals with lower SESdwhich
is independently associated with higher
diabetes prevalenceditis unclearwhether
housing instability is causally related to
developing diabetes. One systematic review did not find higher diabetes prevalence than in the general population
among persons experiencing homelessness, estimating approximately 8% prevalence in adults who do and do not
experience homelessness (94). A recent
study using nationally representative
data from individuals seen in community
health centers found that approximately
37% of individuals with diabetes reported housing instability. This study
also found that individuals with diabetes
and housing instability were more likely to
self-report having an emergency department visit or hospitalization for their diabetes (adjusted OR 5.17, 95% CI 2.08–
12.87) (82). A cross-sectional study in a
single health care system found that
housing instability among individuals
with diabetes was associated with higher
outpatient utilization (incident rate ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.14–1.51) (95). Though
not specific to diabetes, additional work
has linked housing instability to poor
health outcomes and reduced health
care access (91,96–100). A longitudinal
study in the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) health care system found
that experiencing homelessness was associated with higher adjusted odds of
having an HbA1c .8.0% and .9.0%.
Vijayaraghavan et al. (84) identified unstable housing as a key barrier to diabetes
careamonglow-incomeindividuals.There
was an observed linear decrease in diabetes self-efficacy as housing instability
increased (b-coefficient 20.94, 95% CI
21.88 to 20.01, P , 0.01), which was
partially mediated by food insecurity.
Qualitative work has found that unstable housingmakes itmore difficult to engage in self-care, follow self-management
routines, afford diabetes medications and
supplies, and eat healthy foods (91,92).
Choice of medication is important, and
considerations should include medication
cost and the ability to store medication
and diabetes care supplies safely. Brooks
et al. provide a narrative review of considerations for diabetes treatment among
individuals experiencing homelessness
(101).
Housing Instability Interventions and Diabetes
Outcomes. Given its expense, housing is
one of the most difficult health-related
social needs to intervene upon. Housing
intervention studies reporting diabetes
outcomes are few; however, there is
some high-quality evidence for housing
interventions. The Moving To Opportunity forFairHousingDemonstration Project
(MTO), a randomized social experiment
conducted through the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, in
partnership with behavioral scientists
and other federal agencies, was designed
to determine what impact moving from a
high-poverty to a low-poverty census
tract would have on multiple outcomes
(102,103). In 1994–1998, MTO randomized 4,498 women with children living in
public housing within high-poverty census tractsinfive cities to one of three study
arms. The 1,788 women in the experimental arm received Section 8 vouchers
usable only in low-poverty areas (census
tracts with ,10% of the population below
the poverty line) along with counseling
and assistance in finding a private rental
unit. The 1,312 women in the Section
8 arm received traditional unrestricted
vouchers and the usual briefing the local
Section 8 program provided. The 1,398
women in the control arm received no
vouchers but continued to receive MTO
project-based assistance. Those who received vouchers could choose whether to
use the vouchers or not. Findings from
the follow-up survey in 2008 through
2010 found a 21.6% relative reduction in
prevalence of an elevated HbA1c (.6.5%)
in the group that moved to low-poverty
census tracts compared with the control
group, with an absolute difference of
4.31 percentage points (95% CI 27.82
to 20.80). The low-poverty group also
had relative reductions of 13.0% in prevalence of BMI $35 and relative reduction
of 19.1% in BMI $40 kg/m2
, with absolute differences of 4.61 percentage points
(95% CI 28.54 to 20.69) and 3.38 percentage points (95% CI 26.39 to 20.36),
respectively (102). The usual vouchers and
control arms did not differ. Other MTO
outcomes among the group randomized
to low-poverty census tracts included
higher housing quality, education, employment, andearnings as well asmultiple
additional improvements to child and
adult health (103). A 10–15 year follow-up
study found substantial and sustained
reductions in diabetes prevalence, rates
262 Social Determinants of Health and Diabetes Diabetes Care Volume 44, January 2021
of extreme obesity, and improvement in
mental health outcomesamong theadults
who received vouchers to move to lowpoverty neighborhoods and reduction in
extreme obesity among the adults who
received Section 8 vouchers (104). While
not specific to diabetes, a meta-analysis of
randomized trials that provided low-barrier
housing support for individuals experiencing homelessness found significant reductions in health care utilization (105).
Housing interventions may facilitate
access to diabetes care. The Collaborative Initiative to End Chronic Homelessness providedadults whowere chronically
homeless with permanent housing and
supportive primary health care and mental health services (106). Placed persons
were more likely to receive evaluationand
management services (relative risk [RR]
1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.04) than unplaced
persons (107). Placed persons were more
likely to receive HbA1c tests (RR 1.10, 95%
CI 1.02–1.19) and lipid tests (RR 1.09, 95%
CI 1.02–1.17), while for those without
baseline diabetes placement was associated with lower risk of new diabetes
diagnoses (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76–0.99).
Keene et al. (91) suggest the relationship
of stable housing to diabetes management is due to its role as a foundation for
prioritizing care and allowing for the
routinization of diabetes management,
critical to disease control. This suggests
the benefits of supportive and stable
housing may be extended to diabetes
care and prevention. A naturalistic qualitative study of the impact of transitioning
to rental-assisted housing among lowincome, housing-insecure adults with T2DM
reported that rental assistance afforded
individuals more environmental and financial control over life circumstances,
thereby enabling diabetes routines and
allocation of financial resources to diabetes care (108).
Built Environment
The built environment, as defined by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), includes the physical
parts of where people live and work, such
as infrastructure, buildings, streets, and
open spaces (109). Here, built environment factors of walkability and greenspace are reviewed.
Associations of Built Environment with Diabetes Incidence, Prevalence, and Outcomes. A
robust literature has demonstrated associations of the built environment with
obesity-related outcomes (110–113).
However, a smaller body of research
has examined associations of the built
environment with diabetes specifically.
Smalls et al. (114) reported significant
associations of both walking environment (b 5 20.040) and neighborhood
activities (b 5 20.104) with exercise in a
southeastern U.S. population with diabetes. A recent U.S. review and metaanalysis by Chandrabose et al. (113)
examined longitudinal studies of the
built environment and cardiometabolic
health. Results showed strong evidence
for impact of walkability on T2DM outcomes, with four of seven studies (57%)
showing significant findings in the aggregated analyses using objective and
perceived measures of walkability. Although the methods to determine mediation by physical activity in most
studies were ineffective to make conclusions, one study tested the indirect
effect of walkability on 10-year change
in HbA1c and found a partial mediation
effect for self-reported physical activity
using structural equation modeling. For
other measures of built environment,
such as neighborhood recreational facilities or destinations/routes, there was
insufficient data to examine the relationship with T2DM outcomes. A larger
body of research on built environment
and diabetes has been conducted in
countries outside of the U.S (110–112).
In these studies, neighborhood physical
activity (PA) environments, specifically
better walkability of neighborhoods and
access to greenspace, have been consistently associated with lower risk of T2DM
and better outcomes (115,116). Numerous studies have been conducted on
walkability measured by macroscale aspects of the neighborhood, including higher
population density, land use mix, and
aesthetics, to microscale aspects, including sidewalks, street connectivity, and
street safety. A review by Bilal et al. (115)
on walkability and diabetes incidence
and prevalence found that more walkable neighborhoods are associated with
a lower incidence and prevalence of
T2DM. Similarly, Twohig-Bennett and
Jones (117) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the
relationship to diabetes outcomes of
“high” and “low” exposure to greenspace in neighborhoods (defined as
open, undeveloped land with natural
vegetation and/or spaces such as parks
and tree-lined areas). The meta-analysis,
representing 462,220 participants, showed
an association of high exposure with
reductions in the incidence of T2DM (OR
0.71, 95% CI 0.61–0.85) (117). After decades of research, many built environment factors related to PA and obesity
risk have been identified for consideration in urban planning (118).
Neighborhood-Level Interventions on the
Built Environment and Diabetes Outcomes.
Because it is often not feasible or ethical
to randomize neighborhoods to receive
certain structural interventions, natural
experiment designs are used in which
the researcher does not control or withhold intervention allocation to particular
areas; rather, natural or predetermined
variation in allocation occurs, often as a
result of policy intervention (119). Several
review articles of natural experiments
summarize the benefits of policy and built
environment changes on obesity-related
outcomes (112)and diet and PA outcomes
(120,121).The strongestdiet-related studies
were those that evaluated regulations to
the food environment, and the strongest
PA-related studies were those that improved infrastructure for active transport.
Although this literature does not directly
address diabetes outcomes, improvements in obesity and diet and PA behaviors are relevant to populations with
diabetes and warrant rigorous evaluation
(122).
Toxic Environmental Exposures
Toxic environmental exposures can be
naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic in private wells, radon) or introduced into the
environment through human activity
(e.g., pollution, synthetic pesticides) (123).
Marginalized communities in the U.S. are
disproportionately exposed to environmental agents that have evidence of an
association with diabetes, including air
pollution, environmental toxicants, and
ambient noise (124–129), and subgroups
that generate the least pollution have
highest exposures (130).
Factors contributing to inequities in
toxic environmental exposures include
residential segregation and inequity in
goods and services, due in part to systemic racism in environmental regulation
and opportunities (128,130–133). Explanatory factors are closer proximity
of underserved neighborhoods to nearby
pollution sources, poor enforcement of
regulations, and inadequate response to
care.diabetesjournals.org Hill-Briggs and Associates 263

Committee Recommended actions Description
Develop a digital infrastructure that is interoperable
between health care and social care organizations
Establish ACA-recommended digital infrastructure for social care. The Office of the National
Coordinator should support identification of interoperable, secure, platforms for use across
health and social care communities. The Federal Health Information Technology
Coordinating Committee should facilitate data sharing across domains (e.g., health care,
housing, and education). Analytic and technology implementation must have an explicit
focus on equity to avoid unintended consequences such as perpetuation or aggravation of
discrimination, bias, and marginalization.
Finance the integration of health care and social care CMS should define and use flexibility in what social care constitutes Medicaid-covered
services. Health systems, payers, and governments should consider collective financing to
spread risk and create shared returns on investments in social care. Health systems subject
to community benefit regulations should comply with those regulations and should align
their hospital licensing requirements and public reporting with community benefits
regulations and should link their community benefits providing social care.
Fund, conduct, and translate research and evaluation on
the effectiveness and implementation of social care
practices in health care settings
Federal (e.g., NIH, AHRQ, PCORI) and state agencies, payers, providers, delivery systems, and
foundations should contribute to advancing research and evaluation of social care through
funding opportunities, researcher support (i.e., cultivate health services, social sciences,
and cross-disciplinary researchers), and use of experimental trials, rapid learning cycles, and
dissemination of learnings. CMS should fully finance independent state waiver evaluations
to ensure robust evaluation of social care and health care integration pilot programs and
dissemination.

community complaints (134–138). In rural and suburban communities, including
Native American Indian communities,
unregulated private wells are a source
of water contaminants including arsenic
and other metals/metalloids, pesticides,
and hazardous chemicals, affecting millions of people (139–141). Both food
packaging and fast-food consumption,
which can be high in low-income neighborhoods, can expose people to chemicals known to be endocrine disrupters
(142–145). Examples include chemicals
released from plastic packaging during
microwave heating (142), higher urinary
phthalate levels associated with fast food
(145), and higher urinary bisphenol A
levels from canned foods (146). Certain
personal care and cosmetic products,
which are a source of phthalates and
metals (e.g., skin-lightening products,
which are high in mercury), are disproportionately marketed to marginalized
population subgroups (147).
Associations of Environmental Risk Factors
With Diabetes Incidence, Prevalence, and
Outcomes. In 2011, the National Toxicology Program at the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences convened
an international workshop to evaluate
the experimental and epidemiologic evidence on the relationship of environmental chemicals with obesity, diabetes,
and metabolic syndrome (148–150). Evidence was deemed strongest for arsenic,
with relative risks of diabetes found to
range from 1.11 to 10.05 in different
studies (median 2.69) at high arsenic
exposure levels. More recent systematic
reviews and meta-analyses present the
growing literature examining multiple
groups of chemicals (148,151) or specific
groups of chemicals (152–154). Overall,
the evidence supports an increased risk
of diabetes in populations exposed to
environmental chemicals including arsenic, persistent organic pollutants, phthalates, and possibly bisphenol.
In 11 prospective studies of air pollution exposure and incident diabetes in
adults, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) (95%
CI) per 10 mg/m3 increment particulate
matter of ,2.5 mm aerodynamic diameter was 1.10 (1.04–1.17) (155). Other
reviews have reached conclusions consistent with this increased diabetes risk
finding (156–158). The epidemiologic
evidence is also supported by animal
experiments showing that air pollution
exposure can increase susceptibility to
insulin resistance and T2DM (159–161).
These findings highlight that populations
more exposed to air pollution are also
disproportionately at risk for developing
diabetes.
There is epidemiologic and experimental evidence that environmental exposures
increase susceptibility to cardiovascular
disease (CVD) in people with diabetes.
The evidence is extensive for air pollution
exposures (162,163). For example, in
Medicare patients, a daily increase of
10 mg/m3 in particulate matter ,10
mm of aerodynamic diameter was associated with 2.01% increase in CVD hospitalizations for those with diabetes
compared with 0.94% increase among
those without diabetes (162). Short-term
increases in air pollution exposure are
also related to higher risk of stroke
mortality in patients with diabetes compared with those without (164). In an
experimental model, mice with diabetes exposed to diesel exhaust particles
showed increased cardiovascular susceptibility compared with mice without
diabetes (165). In natural experiments in
human populations, air pollution exposure also resulted in increased vascular
reactivity (166) and inflammation in patients with diabetes compared with those
without (167). In addition to air pollution,
some evidence is also available for metals. In the Strong Heart Study of American
Indian adults followed since 1989–1991,
the risk of CVD associated with higher
exposure to arsenic and cadmium was
higher among participants with diabetes
compared with those without diabetes
(168,169). In a clinical trial in patients
with a previous myocardial infarction (Trial toAssess ChelationTherapy [TACT]), the
beneficial effects of repeated chelation
with disodium edetate on cardiovascular
outcomes were greater in patients with
diabetes (170).
Environmental Exposures Interventions and
Diabetes. Few studies have evaluated the
effect of population-based or clinical
interventions related to environmental
exposures and diabetes prevention or
control. The increased risk of diabetes in
populations exposed to environmental
chemicals and the increased susceptibility for diabetes complications in individuals with diabetes exposed to air
pollution potentially provides an opportunity for prevention and treatment that
can be particularly relevant for the most
vulnerable populations. For example, a
comparison of preterm births among
four studies in different countries, before and after the implementation of
smoke-free legislation, has shown reductions in diabetes risk (pooled risk
change 218.4%, 95% CI 218.8 to 22),
although the long-term benefits have
not yet been evaluated (171).
Because individuals generally have
limited control over environmental agents,
themost effective interventions will be at
the population level, through policy and
regulation, with a particular focus on
protecting marginalized and underserved
populations. There is evidence that declines in air pollution levels and metal
exposures have contributed to improvements in CVD development (172,173);
benefits for diabetes development are
pending. Research is also needed to
test intermediate strategies at the clinical
level, such as exposure screening (e.g.,
asking about living near highways or using
private wells for drinking water) and
recommendations to test air or water,
reduce known sources of exposure (e.g.,
minimize packaged foods, avoid heating
food in plastic containers, and minimize
use of certain cosmetic products), and
make home interventions (e.g., install
filters for air or water contaminants)
(174–176).
Food Environment and Diabetes
The food environment can be defined as
the physical presence of food that
affects a person’s diet; a person’s proximity to food store locations; the distribution of food stores, food service, and
any physical entity by which food may be
obtained; or a connected system that
allows access to food (177). It is the
“collective physical, economic, policy
and sociocultural surroundings, opportunities and conditions that influence
people’s food and beverage choices
and nutritional status” (178). It is also
referred to as the community food environment (e.g., number, type, location,
and accessibility of food outlets such as
food stores, markets, or both) and the
consumer-level environment (e.g., healthful, affordable foods in stores, markets,
or both), which interact to affect food
choices and diet quality (179,180). Key
dimensions of the food environment
include accessibility, availability, affordability, and quality (181–184). These
factors, which define the quality of the
food environment, are of particular
266 Social Determinants of Health and Diabetes Diabetes Care Volume 44, January 2021
importance in marginalized communities,
which may have poor access to supermarkets and healthy foods but abundant
access to fast-food outlets and energydense foods and are often disproportionately impacted by physical hazards
(e.g., vacant houses, traffic, and crime)
(78). At their root, differences in the
food environment can be caused by
government policies and incentives,
and the legacy of such policies as redlining and segregation.
Associations of Food Environment With
Diabetes Incidence, Prevalence, and
Outcomes
FoodAccessandAvailability.Cross-sectional
studies have shown associations between
food access, availability, geographic characteristics, and T2DM prevalence. Ahern
et al. (185) examined 3,128 counties
across the U.S. for food access (assessed
as percent of households with no car
living more than one mile from a grocery
store) and food availability (assessed as
number of fast-food restaurants, full-service
restaurants, grocery stores, convenience
stores, and per capita sales in dollars from
local farms made directly to consumers).
Higher access to food was associated with
lower T2DM rates in metro and nonmetro
counties, and higher availability of fullservice restaurants and grocery storesand
lower availability of fast-food and convenience stores were associated with lower
diabetes rates (185). Haynes-Maslow and
Leone (186) similarly found availability
of full-service restaurants to be associated with lower prevalence of diabetes in
adults and availability of fast-food restaurants generally to be associated with
higher diabetes prevalence. However,
the study reported variability in associations among numerous food environment
characteristics based on county composition (low poverty/low minority, low poverty/
medium minority, high poverty/low minority), highlighting complexities in understanding patterns among variables of
county socioeconomic status, demographics, food availability, and diabetes
prevalence (186).
Several observational, longitudinal
studies report neighborhood resources
in general, and access and availability of
the food environment in particular, as
associated with diabetes prevalence and
incidence (187). A systematic review by
den Braver et al. (188) found availability
of fast-food outlets and convenience
stores to be associated with higher
T2DM risk/prevalence and perceived
healthfulness of the food environment
to be associated with lower diabetes risk/
prevalence, but no association was found
between density of grocery stores and
T2DM risk/prevalence. Heterogeneity
across the studies prevented the conduct
of meta-analyses. Gabreab et al. (189)
examined neighborhood, social, and
physical environments and T2DM in
3,700 African Americans through the
Jackson Heart Study and found higher
density of unfavorable food stores was
associated with a 34% higher T2DM incidence after adjusting for individuallevel risk factors. In a longitudinal
employee cohort, Herrick et al. (190)
found that living in a zip code with higher
supermarket density was associated
with a reduction in T2DM risk, while
zip codes with a higher percentage of
poverty and zip codes with higher walkability scores were both associated with
higher diabetes risk. Christine et al. (191)
reported long-term exposure to residential environments that offer resources to
support healthy diets and PA was associated with a lower incidence of T2DM,
although results varied by measurement
method.
Studies have also examined both food
and PA environments in combination and
diabetes risk. Meyer et al. (192) combined measures of neighborhood food
and PA environments and weight-related
outcomes (N 5 14,379) of the Coronary
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA) study, examining population
density–specific (less than vs. greater
than 1,750 people per square kilometer)
clusters of neighborhood indicators: road
connectivity, parks and PA facilities,

and food stores/restaurants. In lower–
population density areas, higher food and
PA resource diversity relative to other
clusters was significantly associated
with higher diet quality (192). In higher–
population density areas, a cluster with
relatively more natural food/specialty
stores, fewer convenience stores, and
more PA resources was associated with
higher diet quality. Neighborhood clusters were inconsistently associated
with BMI or insulin resistance and
not associated with fast-food consumption, or walking, biking, or running (192).
Tabaei et al. (193) examined associations
of residential socioeconomic, food, and
built environments with glycemic control in adults with diabetes ascertained
from the New York City A1C Registry
from 2007 to 2013. Individuals who lived
continuously in the most advantaged
residential areas, including greater ratio
of healthy food outlets to unhealthy
food outlets and residential walkability,
achieved increased glycemic control and
took less time to achieve glycemic control compared with the individuals who
lived continuously in the least advantaged residential areas (193).
Food Affordability. Kern et al. (194) note
that it is reasonable to expect that large
differences in price between healthy and
unhealthy foods would lead to differences in purchasing patterns and resulting diets and that those differences
would be more prominent for individuals
of lower SES. In a longitudinal study, they
examined food affordability and neighborhood price of healthier food relative
to unhealthy food and its association
with T2DM and insulin resistance. Higher
prices of healthy foods relative to unhealthy foods were found to be associated
with lower odds of having a high-quality
diet; however, there was no association
with diabetes incidence or prevalence
(194). More studies are needed in this
area.
Table 5—SDOH and diabetes research recommendations
Research recommendation 1 Consensus is needed around language andmetrics associated with SDOH and
diabetes care that move beyond health care and capture the impact of
social advantage and disadvantage in population settings. Clarity and
consistency in measurement, evaluation, and reporting of progress will
allow for appropriate planning of interventions, allocation of resources,
and analysis of impact in achieving equity goals.
Establish consensus core SDOH definitions and metrics
Research recommendation 2 Examinations of potential differences in pathways or impacts of SDOH based
on characteristics including diabetes type or diagnostic category (e.g.,
T1DM vs. T2DM, gestational diabetes mellitus, prediabetes), age group
(e.g., children and youth, adults, older adults), and different SES (wealthy
vs. middle class vs. poor) are needed. In addition, complexities of SDOH
pathways and impacts for different racial/ethnic groups, based on
historical drivers and policies, warrant elucidation to inform intervention
and mitigation strategies.
Examine specificities in SDOH pathways and impacts among
different populations with diabetes
Research recommendation 3 Multisector partnerships, comprising academic institutions, government
sectors (e.g., housing, education, justice), and public health entities are
required in order to design and test observational and intervention studies
to better understand and intervene on SDOH as root causes of diabetes
disparities. Priorities need to move from compensatory to the nextgeneration of research that will be larger in scope, addressing
foundational causes of disparities (e.g., policy, systems change), and
tested over time across sectors. Complex studies, examining the
interactive effects of multifaceted systems that influence SDOH, will also
transform andmove translational efforts toward large-scale solutions that
promote equity for all populations and mitigate the influence of SDOH on
diabetes outcomes.
Prioritize a next generation of research that targets SDOH as
the root cause of diabetes inequities
Research recommendation 4 For clinical research programs, dissemination and implementation methods
will shorten the translation gap from discovery to impact of evidencebased interventions by addressing the complexity of integrating and
adapting evidence-based practices to real-world community and clinical
settings. This will assure all populations benefit from the billions of U.S. tax
dollars spent on research to prevent diabetes and to improve diabetes
population health.
Use dissemination and implementation science to ensure SDOH
considerations are embedded within diabetes research and
evaluation studies
Research studies must also consider the potential influence of either positive
or negative SDOH (e.g., wealth or economic security vs. poverty, food
security vs. insecurity, stable vs. unstable housing) on intervention
appropriateness and outcomes, on study recruitment and participation,
and on study outcomes and conclusions.
Research recommendation 5 Training on SDOH and their influence on diabetes prevention and treatment
is needed. Training priorities include interdisciplinary science, multisector
collaboration research approaches, and methods to advance root cause
research on SDOH. Additionally, increasing diversity among research
workforces, and fostering educational experiences encompassing
multisector partners will develop a workforce that is congruent with
promoting diabetes health equity.
Train researchers in methodologies and experimental techniques
for multisector and next generation SDOH intervention studies
268 Social Determinants of Health and Diabetes Diabetes Care Volume 44, January 2021
Food Insecurity.Food insecurity is defined
as not having adequate quantity and
quality of food at all times for all household members to have an active, healthy
life (195,196). Approximately 20% of diabetes patients report household food
insecurity (197), and food insecurity is a
risk factor for poor diabetes management (196). Researchers have investigated several pathways through which
food insecurity may worsen T2DM outcomes (198–200). First, in the nutritional
pathway, food insecurity is associated
with lower diet quality (201), which is in
turn associated with higher HbA1c. Food
insecurity incentivizes more affordable,
energy-dense foods that can directly
raise serum glucose (e.g., refined carbohydrates, processed snacks and sweets,
sugar-sweetened beverages, etc.) and
may lead to greater insulin resistance
(202,203). Conversely, low or inconsistent food availability can increase risk of
hypoglycemia. Second, via a compensatory pathway, behavioral strategies necessary to cope with the immediate
problem of food insecurity can inadvertently undermine T2DM management.
For example, financial resources that
might otherwise have been used for
medications or diabetes care supplies
are diverted to meet dietary needs
(197,204–206). Third, through the psychological pathway, the state of food
insecurity, in which meeting basic needs
is outside an individual’s control, undermines self-efficacy and increases depressive symptoms and diabetes distress
(207–210). Several studies have reported a
relationship between food insecurity and
adverse diabetes outcomes (211,212),
and a review by Barnard et al. (213) has
suggested that food insecurity among
patients with and at high risk for
T2DM may be particularly toxic because,
in addition to issues of accessing sufficient
calories overall, the dietary quality of the
foods eaten is even more important than
for the general population. Several crosssectional studies report a relationship
between food insecurity and T2DM diabetes outcomes (214–216), including
poor metabolic control (217,218), experience of severe hypoglycemia in lowincome and low-education samples (218),
lower diabetes self-management behavioral adherence and worse glycemic control (219), and increased outpatient visits
but not increased emergency department/
inpatient visits (95,212).
Food Environment Interventions and
Diabetes
Three studies reported food bank and
pantry interventions with food insecure clients with T2DM (196,220,221).
Seligman et al. (196) conducted a pilot
program in Texas, California, and Ohio
with a pre/post design, encompassing
provision of diabetes-appropriate food,
blood glucose monitoring, self-management
support, and primary care referrals. The
study resulted in improvements in HbA1c,
fruit and vegetable consumption, selfefficacy, and medication adherence.
In a randomized controlled trial of the
intervention, Seligman et al. (220) found
improvements in nutritional consumption,
food security, and distress but no clinical
changes. Palar et al. (221) found reduction
in BMI but not HbA1c and better nutritional and psychosocial outcomes.
Studies have examined effect of supermarket gain or loss on T2DM outcomes. A study conducted within the
setting of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry linked
clinical measures to metrics from a geographic information system based on participants’ residential addresses (115,222,223).
Results over 4 years of tracking supermarket change in low-income neighborhoods showed that relative to no change
in supermarket presence, supermarket
loss was associated with worse HbA1c
trajectories, especially among those with
highest HbA1c. Supermarket gain in neighborhoods was associated with marginally
better HbA1coutcomes, but only for those
with near-normal HbA1c baseline values
(223). In a natural experiment design, the
Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Study on Eating, Shopping, and Health (PHRESH) tested
the effects of adding a supermarket,
along with other neighborhood investments, on cardiometabolic risk factors
among a randomly selected cohort of
residents from two low-income, urban,
and predominately African American
matched neighborhoods (222,224). Results for the intervention neighborhood
(receiving the supermarket) showed improved perceived access to healthy food
(225), and the prevalence of diabetes
increased less in the neighborhood with
the supermarket than in the comparison
neighborhood. Since the initiation of the
supermarket, many other investments
including greenspace, housing, and commercial spaces have been implemented
in the intervention neighborhood (226).
Results of these neighborhood investments on measured BMI, blood pressure,
HbA1c, and HDL cholesterol will be forthcoming. In sum, food environment factors of food unavailability, inaccessibility,
and insecurity each demonstrate associations with worse diabetes risk and
outcomes, and interventions including diabetes-targeted food and self-management
care at food banks and pantries and
increasing grocery store presence in
low-income neighborhoods are few, but
collectively they demonstrate the potential
to impact diabetes risk, clinical outcomes,
and psychosocial outcomes.
Health Care and Diabetes
Health care as a SDOH includes access,
affordability, and quality of care factors.
In the U.S., these factors are highly correlated with race/ethnicity, SES, and place/
geographic region (19).
Associations of Health Care With Diabetes
Incidence, Prevalence, and Outcomes
Access. In population-based studies, having health insurance is the strongest
predictor of whether adults with diabetes have access to diabetes screenings
and care (227). Uninsured adults in the
U.S. population have a higher likelihood
of having undiagnosed diabetes than
adults with insurance (228). Compared
with insured adults with diabetes, the
uninsured have 60% fewer office visits
with a physician, are prescribed 52% fewer
medications, and have 168% more emergency department visits (229). Liese et al.
(230) found that, among adolescents and
young adults with T1DM or T2DM, compared with having private insurance, having state or federal health insurance was
associated with higher HbA1c values by
0.68%, and having no insurance was associated with higher HbA1c by 1.34%.
Having insurance has also been found
to attenuate associations of financial
barriers with higher HbA1c (231).
Geographic access to adult and pediatric endocrinologists varies substantially
by state and county in the U.S (232), with
disparities in access in many of the geographic regions with highest diabetes
prevalence and socioeconomic disadvantage (232,233). Similarly, factors that
increase odds of having a diabetes selfmanagement education program in a geographic area include a higher percentage
of the population with at least a high
school education, a higher percentage of
care.diabetesjournals.org Hill-Briggs and Associates 269
insured individuals, and a lower rate of
unemployment (234). DeVoe et al. (235)
found that among adults with diabetes,
having both insurance and a usual source
of care, rather than one or the other,
conferred the greatest odds of receiving at
least minimum diabetes health care. Being uninsured and without a usual source
of care was associated with three to five
times lower odds of adults receiving an
HbA1c screen, blood pressure check, or
access to urgent care when needed (235).
Among adolescents and young adults with
diabetes who had state or federal health
insurance, not having any usual source of
provider (primary care or diabetes specialist) was associated with higher HbA1c
than having a usual source of provider,
and HbA1c was similar whether in primary
care or specialist care (230).
Affordability. On average, health care
costs of people with diabetes are 2.3
times those of people without diabetes
(229). Approximately 14% to 20% of
adults with diabetes report reducing
or delaying medications due to cost
(236–238). Among adults with diabetes
who are prescribed insulin, rates may
be .25% (236,239). Cost-related or costreducing nonadherence (CRN) is associated with income, insured status, and
type of insurance. Adults with diabetes
with an annual household income of
,$50,000 are more likely to engage in
CRN than their counterparts with income $$50,000, and uninsured adults
with diabetes are more likely to engage in
CRN than those with insurance (236).
Within a diabetes clinic population of
adults with T1DM or T2DM prescribed
insulin, odds of CRN were three times
higher for those with Medicaid or no
insurance compared with those with
Medicare (239). Piette et al. (240) found
differences based on health system
model. Compared with VA patients with
diabetes, risk of CRN was found to be
almost three times higher for privately
insured patients and four to eight times
higher for patients with Medicare, Medicaid, or no health insurance (240).
Higher financial stress, financial insecurity, and financial barriers are associated with likelihood of CRN (231,238).
People with CRN experience poorer diabetes management, higher HbA1c, and
decreased functional status (231,240).
Deaths have been reported from insulin CRN among youth and adults with
T1DM (241).
Quality. Having insurance is the strongest single predictor of whether adults
with diabetes are likely to meet individual quality measures of diabetes care
(242). Sociodemographic disparities in
care quality are well documented in
national reports and recommendations
(2) and appear to remain consistent over
time (243). In a U.S. population-based
study of achievement of a composite
diabetes treatment goal from 2005 to
2016, data from 2013 to 2016 showed
that non-Hispanic Blacks had lower odds
of achieving a composite diabetes quality
measure than non-Hispanic Whites (adjusted OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39–0.83), and
women had lower odds than men (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45–0.80), with
no improvement in diabetes treatment
gaps from prior time periods (2005–2008
and 2009–2012), especially for minorities, women, and younger adults (227).
Within insured settings, disparities have
been reported among Blacks as compared
with Whitesdin measures including dilated eye exam taken; LDL test taken; LDL,
blood pressure, orHbA1c control;and statin
therapy (244–246). A study of 21 VA facilities found Blacks with diabetes were
more likely than Whites with diabetes to
receive care at lower-performing facilities
overall, which explained some racial differences in diabetes quality measures (246).
Health Care Interventions and Diabetes
Community Health Workers. Several systematic reviews have concluded that
community health worker (CHW) interventions using trained lay workforces
are effective for multiple outcomes in
underserved African American and Hispanic adults with T2DM and comorbid
conditions (247–250). CHWs have been
integrated into care delivery (251,252)
with reimbursement in some states (253).
Roles of CHWs include patient navigation, appointment scheduling, visit attendance, patient education, home-based
monitoring, assessment of social needs
and connection with social services, social
support, and advocacy (252,254). Reported outcomes include better diabetes
knowledge and self-care behaviors, increased quality oflife, reducedemergency
visits and hospitalizations, reduced costs,
and modest improvements in glycemic
control (247–250,255), using home-based
or integrated health team delivery
models (252,256). A majority of the
CHW interventions designed for adult
populations with diabetes have been
diabetes-focused in content and goals
and have utilized structured curricula
(254); however, one series of studies
reported use of a standardized, all-condition CHW intervention and found modest gain in diabetes outcomes along with
additional health benefits (257,258).
Organizational Interventions. Systematic
reviews report improvements in quality
of diabetes care among racial/ethnic minorities resulting from quality improvement employing health information
technology (i.e., patient registries in the
electronic health record, computerized
decision support for providers, reminders,
centralized outreach for diabetes patients overdue for specific services)
(245,259,260). There is also evidence
of effectiveness of self-management interventions delivered directly to underserved patients with diabetes when
interventions are designed to overcome
barriers. For example, the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)-
sponsored National Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP) Medicaid demonstration
found CDC-recognized DPP lifestyle change
programs were effective in achieving performance measures among Medicaid recipients in Maryland and Oregon, and
additional strategies (i.e., transportation
assistance and child care) facilitated the
highretention reportedover the12months
of DPP visits (261). In a series of studies, a
problem-based self-management training
addressing multiple life barriers to care
in low-income and minority populations
was adapted for low literacy and prevalent
diabetes-related functional limitations
(e.g., low vision, physical disability, and
mild cognitive impairment) that impede
self-management education (73,262). The
approach has proven effective in improvingclinicaloutcomes (HbA1c,bloodpressure),
self-care behaviors, and self-management
knowledge and problem-solving skills in
low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and rural populations (76,263,264).
Policy. Studies have examined the impact
of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on
insurance coverage and health care access for patients with diabetes (265).
Analyses of NHIS data from 2009 and
2016 found an increase nationwide of
770,000 more adults with diabetes aged
18 to 64 years with health insurance
coverage in 2016, with a significant increase in coverage seen among Whites,
Blacks, and Hispanics, people with family
270 Social Determinants of Health and Diabetes Diabetes Care Volume 44, January 2021
income ,$35,000, and people across
educational attainment strata (less than
high school and more than high school)
(266). Among people with diabetes in the
lowest income strata, the proportion of
income spent on health costs decreased
significantly from 6.3% to 4.8% (266).
Other studies found increased access to
care, diabetes management, and health
status among people with diabetes in
Medicaid expansion states as compared
with their counterparts in non–Medicaid
expansion states (267); increased rates
of diabetes detection and diagnosis
among Medicaid patients with undiagnosed diabetes in states with Medicaid
expansion (268); and reduction in costrelated medication nonadherence rates
and uninsured rates among people with
diabetes following ACA (269).
Social Context and Diabetes
Several multidimensional factors shape
the social environment as a determinant of health (270), including social
capital, social cohesion, and social support (28,29). Social capital is defined as
the features of social structures that
serve as resources for collective action
(e.g., interpersonal trust, reciprocity
norms, and mutual aid) (271–273). Bonding social capital refers to trusting and
co-operative relations between members of a network who see themselves
as being similar in terms of their shared
social identity; by contrast, bridging social capital refers to aspects of respect
and mutuality between people who do not
share social identities (e.g., differing by
race/ethnicity, social class, age) (274–276).
Racism, discrimination, and inclusion versusexclusionaremacro-level social capital
factors that impact health (28).
Social cohesion refers to the extent of
connectednessand solidarityamonggroups
in a community (271,277) and has two dimensions: reduction of inequalities and
patterns of social exclusion of population
subgroups from full participation in society (278) and strengthening of social relationships and interactions (279–281). Social
cohesion actions facilitate the goal of keeping the society united, not only through social relations, community ties,and intergroup
harmony but also through reducing bias
and discrimination toward economically disadvantaged groups within a society, such as
women and ethnic minorities (28).
Social support describes experiences in
individuals’ formal and informal personal
relationships as well as their perceptions
of those relationships. Categories include
emotional support, tangible support, informational support, and companionship
(282–285). Social support is theorized to
operate by either buffering the effects
of poor health or by directly impacting
health (285,286).
Associations of Social ContextWith Diabetes
Incidence, Prevalence, and Outcomes
A systematic review by Flor et al. (287) ˆ
concluded that social capital was positively associated with diabetes control
among different populations, independent of the quality or quantity of social
capital. However, the few studies available and variations among populations
and measures limit the ability to draw
firm conclusions related to dimensions of
social capital and whether the association is the same at the individual or
neighborhood level (272,288–290). Gebreab et al. (189), using data from the
Jackson Heart Study, examined social
cohesion, measured as trust in neighbors, shared values with neighbors, willingness to help neighbors, and extent to
which neighbors get along. The study
revealed higher neighborhood social cohesion was associated with a 22% lower
incidence of T2DM (189). Studies demonstrating the relationship between social support and diabetes have associated
increased social support with better glycemic control and improved quality of life
(291–295), while lack of social support
has been associated with increased mortality and diabetes-related complications
(291).
A number of studies suggest social
cohesion, social capital, and social support may influencedor be influenced
bydracism and discrimination (296).
Racism interacts with other social entities, creating a set of dynamic, interdependent components that reinforce each
other, sustaining racial inequities and
promoting both institutional- and individuallevel discrimination across various sectors
of society impacting diabetes incidence
(296,297). For example, Whitaker et al.
(298) documented associations of major
and everyday discrimination experiences with incident diabetes among a diverse sample of 5,310 middle-aged to
older adults from the Multi-Ethnic Study
of Atherosclerosis. The Black Women’s
Health Study found that, when compared
with women in the lowest quartile of
exposure, those in the highest quartile of
exposure to everyday racism had a 31%
increased risk of diabetes (HR 1.31, 95%
CI 1.20–1.42), and women with the highest exposure to lifetime racism had a 16%
increased risk (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05–
1.27); both associations were mediated
by BMI (298,299). Further work is needed
to understand the multiple ways that the
social environment influences inequities
in diabetes outcomes.
Social Context Interventions and Diabetes
Outcomes
To our knowledge, there is no empirical
research on social capital or social cohesion interventions and impact on diabetes outcomes, but a body of literature
has examined effects of social support.
The systematic review by Strom and
Egede (284) of 18 observational studies
of adults with T2DM found that higher
levels of social support were associated
with outcomes including better glycemic
control, knowledge, treatment adherence, quality of life, diagnosis awareness
and acceptance, and stress reduction
(284). Lack of social support has been
linked with increased mortality and diabetes-related complications in T2DM
(291,295). Strom and Egede’s review of
16 social support intervention studies
demonstrated improved diabetes-related
outcomes (clinical, psychosocial, and/or
self-management behavior change) in
adults with T2DM, and improvements in
clinical outcomes (HbA1c, blood pressure,
lipids) appeared to be unrelated to the
source or delivery (i.e., peer support, couples/spouse, or nurse manager).
With regard to preferencesdin a
study conducted before the coronavirus
disease 2019 pandemicdSarkar et al.
(300) found that, compared with White
adults with diabetes, Hispanics with diabetes preferred telephone-based and
group support (including promotoras),
while African Americans demonstrated
more variability in their preferences (i.e.,
telephone, group, internet). Reliance on
support from family and community
tended to be higher in minority populations, while Whites relied more on media
and health care professionals (300).
LINKAGES ACROSS HEALTH CARE
AND COMMUNITY SECTORS TO
ADDRESS SDOH
International and U.S. national committees have convened to provide guidance
care.diabetesjournals.org Hill-Briggs and Associates 271
on SDOH intervention approaches. These
expert committee recommendations are
not specific to any disease; rather, they
are applicable to all conditions and populations of health inequity. Table 3 displays recommendations from the WHO
Commission on Social Determinants of
Health (27), the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
(NASEM) (formerly, Institute of Medicine)
Committee on the Recommended Social
and Behavioral Domains and Measures
for Electronic Health Records (80), the
NASEM Committee on Educating Health
Professionals to Address the Social Determinants of Health (301), and the
NASEM Committee on Integrating Social
Needs Care into the Delivery of Health
Care to Improve the Nation’s Health (5).
The WHO recommendations are unique
in their emphasis on root-cause, multisector interventions designed to remove
the SDOH as a barrier to health equity.
The NASEM recommendations are based
in the health care sector and, collectively,
focus on integration of SDOH into the
health care mission, operations, and financial model. Accountable care organizations, value-based purchasing, and
shared savings programs could be intentionally designed to support and incentivize health care systems to address
patients’ health-related social needs as a
strategy to improve health outcomes (5).
The Accountable Health Communities is
one current CMS demonstration project
examining impact on health care costs of
three models for health care response to
SDOH through linkages with community
services: awareness (screening for social
needs within the health care setting and
patient referral to services using an inventory of available local community services), assistance (screening, referral, plus
navigation to enable access to and use of
communityservices),andalignment(screening, referral, community service navigation,
plus partner alignment using a “backbone”
organization for capacity building, data
sharing among community and health
care partners, and scaling of services)
(302). Many health care systems are utilizing electronic medical records and
health information exchanges to capture
SDOH data and commercially available
SDOH algorithms to identify patients at
social risk and trigger service referrals
(303). NASEM provided assessment questions to capture SDOH domains and
frequencies for assessment (304) with
evidence of feasibility (305). In addition,
Table 4 displays publicly available resources and tools to aid providers in addressing individual patients’ social needs.
DISCUSSION
There is SDOH evidence supporting associations of SES, neighborhood and
physical environment, food environment, health care, and social context
with diabetes-related outcomes. Inequities in living and working conditions and
the environments in which people reside
have a direct impact on biological and
behavioral outcomes associated with diabetes prevention and control (12,48).
Life-course exposure based on the length
of time one spends living in resourcedeprived environmentsddefined by poverty, lack of quality education, or lack of
health caredsignificantly impacts disparities in diabetes risk, diagnosis, and outcomes (12,48,306). Although the review
reports SDOH intervention studies for
aspects of housing, built and food environment, and health care, there appears
to be relatively limited U.S.-based research examining impact on diabetes of
interventions designed to target education, income, occupation, toxic environmental exposures, social cohesion, and
social capital.
In the U.S., integrating social context
into health care delivery has become a priority strategy (5–8). A clinical context
alone, however, is too narrow to accommodate systemic SDOH influences. Structural and legal interventions are needed
to address root causes driving SDOH
(27,307). Similarly, additional emphasis
is needed on a next generation of research
that prioritizes interventions impacting
the root causes of diabetes inequities,
rather than compensatory interventions
assisting the individual to adapt to inequities (18,308). For example, in the U.S.,
proficient literacy and resulting health
literacy are disproportionately low inmarginalized populations and communities
(42), with historical sociopolitical root
causes. U.S. antiliteracy laws for Blacks,
which prohibited Blacks from being taught
to read or write, persisted until the 1930s
in some states (309,310), and laws prohibiting African Americans from attending
public and private schools Whites attended continued until 1954 and 1976, respectively (311). Although adapting health
materials for low-literacy suitability is an
effective intervention to compensate for
centuries of legal racial discrimination in
educational access and quality, a nextgeneration intervention might target
the education sector and implement
delivery of high-quality early education
to all within both the public and private
school systems and with equitable educational funding for sociodemographic
populations. Similarly, while partnerships to bring bags of healthy groceries
to low-income families living in food
deserts are important to compensate
for food deserts, a next-generation approach might target historical redlining
and zoning policies that are the root
cause of absence of supermarkets and
fresh food markets in minority and lowerincome neighborhoods (312–314).
The review has limitations. First, the
undertaking was designed to summarize
literature on the range of SDOH identified as having impact on diabetes outcomes. As such, this article describes
findings from systematic reviews and
meta-analyses as well as more recent
published studies on the named SDOH; it
was not designed as a primary systematic
review of all published research on the
topic. Second are limitations of the research itself, including wide variability in
measures and definitions used in studies
within an SDOH area, making it more
difficult to describe outcomes for an
SDOH area in a consistent or uniform
manner or to report quantitative outcomes derived from meta-analyses.
Third, this review was U.S.-focused; conclusions from SDOH research in other
countries, which in some instances may
utilize more standardly defined SDOH
variables (e.g., occupation) are not part
of this initial review. Finally, the many
complexities ofSDOHand their potentially
different pathways and impacts on populations arebeyond the scope of thisinitial
review and require attention to specificity
in designs of future SDOH research in
diabetes.
Recommendations for SDOH research
in diabetes resulting from this SDOH review are described in Table 5 and include
establishing consensus SDOH definitions
and metrics, designing studies to examine specificities based on populations,
prioritizing next-generation interventions, embedding SDOH context within
dissemination and implementation science in diabetes, and training researchers in methodological techniques for
272 Social Determinants of Health and Diabetes Diabetes Care Volume 44, January 2021
future SDOH intervention studies. By addressing these critical elements, there is
potential for progress to be realized in
achieving greater health equity in diabetes and across health outcomes that are
socially determined.
