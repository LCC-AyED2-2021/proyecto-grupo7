After the recognition in December 2019 of a cluster of
patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in
Wuhan caused by the novel coronavirus, CoV-19,1
China and the world have faced the extraordinary
challenge of a previously unrecognized viral illness
with high infectivity.2 Every year, millions of persons
(5%-15% of the world's population) contract
influenza,3,4 causing between 300 000 and 600 000
excess respiratory deaths.5 In China alone, recent estimates put the annual influenza-associated mortality
rate at more than 88 000 persons,6 likely in excess of
any potential outcome of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). Regardless of the potential for spread of
COVID-19, as with influenza-related mortality,7 diabetes is an important risk factor for adverse outcome.
Mortality rates among persons with diabetes in Hong
Kong age 75 and over from pneumonia currently
exceed mortality rates in this age group from cardiovascular disease and from cancer.8 Similar evidence of
risk among persons with diabetes has been reported
for the two earlier CoV infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beginning in 2002 and affecting more than 8000 persons, mainly in Asia9,10 and
the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012
affecting more than 2000 persons, mainly in Saudi
Arabia.11 As MERS-CoV binds to the receptor-binding
domain of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), a
transgenic mouse model expressing this DPP-IV
receptor on pulmonary alveolar cells has been used to
study the effect of diabetes in worsening disease
severity, showing an association of diabetes with
greater weight loss and greater pulmonary inflammation, with macrophage infiltrates similar to those seen
clinically in the disease.12
We acknowledge the frontline medical staff working
day and night in China to rescue critical cases and protect the public health. We know that these great efforts
are now and will be in the future crucial in overcoming
COVID-19. Providing care to people with diabetes is an
important part of the effort. The Journal of Diabetes was
started more than a decade ago in a spirit of collaboration
between East and West addressing the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, management, complications, and
prevention of diabetes. The journal is issuing a call for
submission of commentaries, original articles, and case
reports regarding issues with COVID-19 in patients with
diabetes, as well as descriptions of basic aspects of the
interrelationships between diabetes and the novel CoV.
We hope in this way to support the thousands of Chinese
medical workers involving themselves in the care of
patients with COVID-19, and we look forward to these
efforts helping our goal of eradication of the disease.
