Abstract
Backgound: To figure out whether diabetes is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Methods: A total of 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID-19 were studied. Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings,
chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and
analysed.
Results: We found that COVID-19 patients without other comorbidities but with
diabetes (n = 24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injuryrelated enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable
state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, serum
levels of inflammation-related biomarkers such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum
ferritin and coagulation index, D-dimer, were significantly higher (P < .01) in diabetic
patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are
more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration
of COVID-19.
Conclusions: Our data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a
risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19. More intensive
attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Since the end of 2019, a newly identified illness termed COVID-19
has spread rapidly through China and the rest of the world. A novel
beta-coronavirus, known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome
corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the COVID-19 pathogen, which triggered severe pneumonia and acute, even lethal, lung
failure.1 By 2 March 2020, the virus had caused 80 303 confirmed
cases and 2948 deaths in China and cases have been reported in
45 countries, including the United States, Korea, Japan and Italy. In
the existing cases, some patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia
developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and a part of †

them worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ
failure.1
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the surface receptor
for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), directly interacting with the spike
glycoprotein (S protein).2 A recent study suggests that the affinity
between ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARSCoV-2 is 10 to 20 times higher than that with the RBD of SARS-CoV,
indicating that ACE2 might also be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.3
ACE2 was reported to be widely expressed in various organ systems
including the cardiovascular system, kidneys, lungs and brain,4,5 which
might provide an explanation for why some COVID-19 patients died
of multiple organ failure.
Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide and is anticipated to rise substantially over the next decades.6
Several investigations have demonstrated a higher susceptibility to
some infectious diseases in diabetic people, like Staphylococcus aureus
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
7-9 probably owing to the dysregulated
immune system.10 It has reported that plasma glucose levels and diabetes are independent predictors for mortality and morbidity in
patients with SARS.11 A retrospective study in Wuhan, China revealed
that of the 41 COVID-19 patients, 32% of them had underlying diseases, and among which 20% was diabetes.12 Therefore, these diabetic patients might be at increased risk of COVID-19 and have a
poorer prognosis.
To figure out whether diabetes is a risk factor to influence the
progression and prognosis of COVID-19, 174 COVID-19 patients
who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from 10 February 2020
to 29 February 2020 were included in this study according to the
inclusion criteria. Their basic information, laboratory examinations,
chest computed tomography (CT) scans as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed. We found that, as a common
underlying disease in COVID-19 patients, diabetes is associated with
worse prognosis.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective study of 174 patients with SARS-Cov-2
infection who were admitted to Wuhan Union hospital from
10 February 2020 to 29 February 2020. The enrolled patients in this
study are all diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim
guidance. Wuhan Union Hospital is a designated hospital for treating
COVID-19. In the first part, we divided all patients into two groups
based on whether they had diabetes. In the second part, we excluded
patients with comorbidities other than diabetes to avoid the impact of
other comorbidities, and then the patients with diabetes and patients
without diabetes were separated into two groups. This case series
was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board of Wuhan Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and
Technology. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics
Commission of the designated hospital for the emerging infectious
diseases.
We extracted demographic data, medical history, exposure history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, and the
treatment measures from electronic medical records. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the first symptom showed
up. Clinical outcomes were followed up to 3 March 2020. All data
were analysed by the research team and double checked by two physicians (Y.S. and L.Z.).
Laboratory validation of SARS-CoV-2 was performed at Wuhan
Union Hospital. Throat-swab specimens that obtained from the upper
respiratory tract of patients at admission were stored in viraltransport medium. Total RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the
respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Zhongzhi, Wuhan, China). SARSCoV-2 was examined by RT-PCR as described previously.12
All COVID-19 patients met the following criteria:
(a) Epidemiology history, (b) Fever or other respiratory symptoms,
(c) Typical CT image abnormities of viral pneumonia, and (d) Positive
result of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Patients were divided into
the diabetes and non-diabetes group according to their medical history. Furthermore, CT imaging scores were used to quantify the pathological changes of COVID-19 patients. The values were obtained by
two physicians, who were blinded to the patients' clinical data, using
an introduced scoring system described as below.

Categorical variables were expressed as frequency rates and percentages (%), and continuous variables were expressed as mean
(SD) if they are normally distributed or median (IQR) if not. Categorical
variables between groups were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher
exact test, and continuous variables were analysed using Student's
t test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. All statistical analyses
were performed using the SPSS 13.0 software. a
P-value <.05 was considered statistically significant.
3 | RESULTS
Of 174 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was
59 years (interquartile range, 49-67) and 76 (43.7%) were men. For
the all patients the most common symptoms were fever (78.2%), chill
(68.4%), cough (32.2%), fatigue (27%), chest tightness (25.9%), shortness of breath (24.1%) and myalgia (20.7%), whereas nausea (9.8%),

headache (6.9%), pharyngalgia (5.2%) and chest pain (8.6%) were relatively rare. The most common of underlying comorbidities were
chronic diseases, such as hypertension (24.7%) and diabetes (21.2%).
Compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes had
more cardiovascular disease (32.4% vs 14.6%) and less fever (59.5%
vs 83.2%), but had no significant differences in gender and age, as well
as mortality (Table 1).
Of all patients, there were many typically abnormal laboratory
test results (Table 2), including enzymes like α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH; 190 [IQR, 146-263]), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT; 26 [IQR,21-37]), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH; 248 [IQR,
188-362]) and inflammation-related markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP; 17.7 [IQR, 7.34-51.8]), serum ferritin (375.9 [IQR,
169.5-746.9]), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 28 [IQR, 13-59]),
IL-6 (11.75 [IQR, 5.1-28.2]), as well as coagulation parameters, such as
D-dimer (0.67 [IQR, 0.3-1.4]) and fibrinogen (FIB; 4.78 [IQR, 3.28-5.8]).
In addition, the absolute counts of lymphocytes (0.96 [IQR, 0.7-1.3])
and neutrophils (2.7 [IQR, 1.8-4.6]) also show abnormal change.
Furthermore, we found that the absolute counts of neutrophils

CRP (32.8 [IQR, 11.3-93] vs 16.3 [IQR, 7.17-43.9]), ESR (67 [47.5-81]
vs 23 [10-49]), as well as D-dimer (1.15 [IQR, 0.83-2.11] vs 0.54
[0.25-1.1]) were significantly higher in diabetes group compared to
non-diabetes group. Beyond that, the absolute count of lymphocytes
(0.86 [IQR, 0.5-1.3] vs 0.97 [0.74-1.3]) and red blood cells (3.9 [IQR,
(3.5-4.2)] vs 4.17 [3.8-4.5]), and the level of haemoglobin (117 [IQR,
105-123.5] vs 127 [117-136]; Table 2) were significantly lower in diabetes group compared to non-diabetes group. These data showed
that the COVID-19 patients with diabetes are at higher risk of excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state,
which may contribute to a poorer prognosis of COVID-19.
Studies have shown that comorbidities, like chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension and malignancy, may predispose to
poorer clinical outcomes.13 Therefore, we further explored the impact
of comorbidities on the prognosis of the COVID-19 patients without
diabetes, and we found that levels of HBDH (208 [IQR, 147-264.5] vs
141.5 [IQR, 124.75-150.5]), ALT (27 [IQR, 19-47] vs 18.5 [IQR,
13-24]), LDH (281 [IQR, 196-388] vs 186.5 [IQR, 177-204.5]),
γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT; 28 [IQR, 17-55] vs 13 [IQR, 11-15.25])
and CRP (25.4 [IQR, 11.8-54.7] vs 7.43 [IQR, 3.14-13.45]), serum ferritin (434.5 [267.2-710.4] vs 128.9 [57.25-193.15]), ESR (26 [13-58]
vs 8 [7-26]), IL-6 (13.7 [IQR, 5.8-28.2] vs 4.13 [IQR, 3.14-10.61]), as
well as D-dimer (0.67 [IQR, 0.32-1.25] vs 0.25 [0.22-0.31]), FIB (4.79
[IQR, 3.8-5.9] vs 3.75 [IQR, 3.04-4.75]) and the absolute count of neutrophils (2.5 [IQR, 1.6-4.2] vs 2.54 [IQR, 2.05-3.22]) were significantly
higher in comorbidity group compared to non-comorbidity group.
Beyond that, the absolute counts of lymphocytes (0.95 [IQR,
0.73-1.2] vs 1.33 [1.17-1.63]) and red blood cells (4.1 [IQR, (3.7-4.4)]
vs 4.36 [4.14-4.64]), and the level of haemoglobin (125.5 [IQR,
115.8-136] vs 133 [120-137.75]; Table S1) were significantly lower in
comorbidity group compared to non-comorbidity group. These data
showed that the COVID-19 patients with comorbidity is at higher risk
of tissue injury-related enzymes release, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state, which may signifying a
poorer prognosis of COVID-19. These results prove that comorbidities
do have an impact on the progression and prognosis of COVID-19.
Since our purpose is to explore whether diabetes is a risk factor
for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19, we next excluded
patients with comorbidities other than diabetes to avoid the impact of
other comorbidities on the results. Our findings are as follows. Compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes were
older (61 [IQR, 57-69] vs 32 [IQR, 30-37]), had more nausea and
vomiting (16.7% vs 0%) and higher mortality(16.7% vs 0%), but had no
significant differences in gender and other baseline symptoms, followup time, as well as the time from onset of symptom to hospital admission between the two groups (Table 3).
On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected
among all patients. The prominent radiologic abnormalities were bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation,
which is consistent with other recent reports.1 The representative
chest CT imaging of patients with or without diabetes were compared,
and the latter showed more severe pathological changes than the former (Figure 1A). Furthermore, the severity of pathological changes
was evaluated by the quantifiable score system described before. We
found that the diabetes group presented higher CT imaging score
compared with non-diabetes group (Figure 1B).
It is worthy to note that levels of HBDH (181 [IQR, 170-204.5] vs
141.5 [IQR, 124.75-150.5]), ALT (24.5 [IQR, 20.25-38.75] vs 18.5

Figure 3) were significantly lower in diabetes group compared to nondiabetes group. These data showed that diabetes may contribute to a
poorer prognosis of COVID-19.
Further, we analysed the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the pathology
of diabetes. We found that patients with diabetes control blood glucose levels with insulin or oral medicine before admission. Among
them, 29.2% of the patients took insulin before and increased the
dose of insulin after admission, and 37.5% of the patients took oral
medicine before admission and started insulin therapy after admission,
which meant that patients had poor glycemic control during hospitalization. Of all the diabetic patients, only three had diabetic complications, and those patients with diabetic complications were more likely
to die as shown in Table 5.
Finally, we explored the impact of comorbidities on the prognosis
of patients with diabetes. Through our analysis, although the indicators
for diabetic patients with other comorbidities are slightly higher than
those without other comorbidities, no matter evaluated from organ
damage, inflammatory factors or hypercoagulability, other comorbidities
have little effect on the prognosis of patients with diabetes (Table S2).
4 | DISCUSSION
Common perceptions associate diabetes with a generally increased
mortality and morbidity to infectious diseases, although epidemiologic
data that would prove this are surprisingly scarce. However, it seems
to be confirmed that diabetes predisposes to certain types of infection and death,6-9,11 but it is still unknown whether diabetes is a risk
factor for the prognosis of COVID-19. Type 2 diabetes is widely
viewed as a chronic, low-grade inflammatory disease caused by longterm immune system imbalance, metabolic syndrome or nutrient
excess associated with obesity.14,15 Obesity-associated inflammation is
characterized by an increased abundance and activation of innate and
adaptive immunity cells in adipose tissue along with an increased release
of inflammatory factors and chemokines locally and systemically.16 On

the other side, data from human and animal studies suggest that some
viruses are diabetogenic.17 Jali et al18 reported two individuals presenting with acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for a brief and
transient period after being infected with chicken pox. And in a study of
SARS, Yang et al11 found that even in non-severe patients who have
not been treated with glucocorticoid drugs, their fasting blood glucose
levels are higher. Another study found that the immunostaining of
ACE2 protein is strong in islets, but weak in exocrine tissues which
means coronavirus might cause diabetes by damaging islets seriously.19
Since viral infection may cause sharp fluctuation of blood glucose level
of diabetes patients, which adversely affect the recovery of patients,
there is a reason to suspect that diabetes combined with SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia may form a vicious circle, which is detrimental to the prognosis of COVID-19.
Reports showed that ICU patients, non-ICU patients and recovery
patients differ in CT imaging results, which means CT results can be
used as one of the indicator for determining the severity of the SARSCoV-2 pneumonia.20 According to the quantifiable score, we found
that the diabetes group presented higher CT imaging score compared
with non-diabetes group, which means pneumonia in diabetic patients
is more severe than non-diabetic patients.
In addition to imaging results, laboratory results also give us some
hints. Biochemical results showed that some indicative enzymes were
abnormally elevated in the blood of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, including LDH, HBDH, ALT and GGT, which indicated the
injury of myocardium, kidney and liver. This result is consistent with
the extensive distribution of SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2,5 and can
also partially explain why some patients died from multiple organ
failure.1 It is important to note that the levels of these enzymes were
even higher in patients with diabetes when compared to patients
without diabetes, which give us a clue that the injure of organs was
much more serious in diabetes patients group than those without diabetes. In addition, our study found that the levels of total protein,
albumin, prealbumin and haemoglobin are significantly lower in
patients with diabetes compared to individuals without diabetes,
which means diabetes patients are more likely to be undernourished.
According to a recent report, after analysing 138 hospitalized
patients with COVID-19, they found that neutrophilia related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasion, coagulation activation related to
sustained inflammatory response and acute kidney injury related to
direct effects of the virus might be associated with the death of
patients with COVID-19.12 And other study also found that patients
with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, especially those with severe pneumonia, have significantly reduced lymphocyte counts and significantly
increased inflammatory factors, such as IL-6.20 In fact, in the advanced
stage of SARS and Ebola virus infections, cytokine storms are also the
main cause of eventual death for many patients. In our study, we
found that, compared to patients without diabetes, absolute count of
lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with diabetes is significantly lower, while the absolute count of neutrophils is remarkably
higher. Furthermore, the serum levels of some inflammation-related
biomarker are much higher compared to those without diabetes, such
as IL-6, serum ferritin, ESR and CRP. It's noteworthy that for diseases
that can induce a cytokine storm. IL-6 is a very good predictor of disease severity and prognosis, and its expression time is longer than
other cytokines (TNF and IL-1).21 In addition, a significant rise in serum

ferritin indicates the activation of the monocyte-macrophage system,
which is a crucial part of inflammatory storm. These results indicate
that patients with diabetes are susceptible to form an inflammatory
storm, which eventually lead to rapid deterioration of COVID-19.
During the inflammatory storm, the D-dimer increases significantly.
In the early stage, this is the result of inflammation activating plasmin.
However, as inflammation progresses and the presence of hypoxia,
hypoxia-induced molecules can activate thrombin directly, and the activation of monocyte-macrophages would also secrete a mass of tissue
factors and activate the exogenous coagulation pathway, which lead to
an overall hypercoagulable state or even disseminated intravascular
coagulation. In our study, we found that level of D-dimer and FIB was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes, which indicate that they are
more prone to a hypercoagulable state than patients without diabetes.
Clinical medication showed that the insulin dose increased after
the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2, which shows that the
virus has an impact on the patient's glucose metabolism. Dysregulation of glucose metabolism will aggravate diabetes and then
affect the severity of pneumonia, which works as an amplification
loop. Meanwhile, the diabetic complications signify the severity of
diabetes, and these patients with diabetic complications showed a
higher mortality rate, which further proves that diabetes is a risk factor for the prognosis of COVID-19, and the severity of diabetes is
positively correlated with the poor prognosis.
All in all, whether interference from other comorbidities is present
or not, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients with diabetes
are more severe than those without diabetes evaluating from organ
damage, inflammatory factors or hypercoagulability, and are more
likely to progress into a worse prognosis. Therefore, diabetes might
could be considered as a risk factor for the outcome of SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia, and more intensive attention should be paid to patients
with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.
